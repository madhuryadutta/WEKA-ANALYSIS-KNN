A2A039TZMZHH9Y,B00004Y2UT,Bill Lewey blewey,So good that I bought another one.  Love the heavy cord and gold connectors.  Bass sounds great.  I just learned last night how to coil them up.  I guess I should read instructions more carefully.  But no harm done still works great!,The Best Cable,1356048000,12 21 2012,Best
A1UPZM995ZAH90,B00004Y2UT,Brian,I have used monster cables for years and with good reason. The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone. Simple fact: cables break but getting to replace them at no cost is where its at.,Monster Standard 100 - 21 Instrument Cable,1390089600,01 19 2014,Best
AJNFQI3YR6XJ5,B00004Y2UT,Fender Guy Rick,I now use this cable to run from the output of my pedal chain to the input of my Fender Amp. After I bought Monster Cable to hook up my pedal board I thought I would try another one and update my guitar. I had been using a high end Planet Waves cable that I bought in the 1980s... Once I found out the input jacks on the new Monster cable didnt fit into the Fender Strat jack I was a little disappointed... I didnt return it and as stated I use it for the output on the pedal board. Save your money... I went back to my Planet Waves Cable...I payed $30.00 back in the eighties for the Planet Waves which now comes in at around $50.00. What Im getting at is you get what you pay for. I thought Waves was a lot of money back in the day...but I havent bought a guitar cable since this one...20 plus years and still working...Planet Waves wins.,Didnt fit my 1996 Fender Strat...,1353024000,11 16 2012,Average
A3M1PLEYNDEYO8,B00004Y2UT,G. Thomas Tom,Perfect for my Epiphone Sheraton II.  Monster cables are well constructed.  I have several and never had any problems with any of them over the years.  Got this one because I wanted the 90 degree plug.,Great cable,1215302400,07 6 2008,Best
AMNTZU1YQN1TH,B00004Y2UT,Kurt Robair,Monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either. This isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time.

A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B00004Y2UT,Mike Tarrani Jazz Drummer,Monster makes a wide array of cables including some that are very high end. I initially purchased a pair ofMonster Rock Instrument Cable - 21 Feet - Angled to Straight 1/4-Inch plugto use with my keyboards but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar I thought Id pinch a few pennies.  I am so glad I did.I compared this cable model to the more expensive models I previously purchased and aside from looks could not detect any difference in sound. I Swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards ensuring that each model was used on each instrument - still no difference.What the more expensive model has going for it is looks. I am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling.Bottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision. You may find as I did that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value even from the same manufacturer.,One of the best instrument cables within the brand,1334793600,04 19 2012,Best
A35QFQI0M46LWO,B00005ML71,Christopher C,I got it to have it if I needed it. I have found that i dont really need it that often and rarely use it. If I was really good I can see the need. But this is a keyboard not an organ.,It works great but I hardly use it.,1398124800,04 22 2014,Good

A2PD27UKAD3Q00,B00005ML71,Wilhelmina Zeitgeist coolartsybabe,I bought this to use with my keyboard. I wasnt really aware that there were other options for keyboard pedals. It doesnt work as smoothly as the pedals do on an acoustic piano which is what Id always used. Doesnt have the same feel either. Nowhere close.In my opinion a sustain pedal like the M-Audio SP-2 Sustain Pedal with Piano Style Action or other similar pedal is a much better choice. The price difference is only a few dollars and the feel and action are so much better. The only thing Ive found the Yamaha FC-5 Sustain Pedal is good for is taking up space in a drawer where I keep my electric guitar pedals.,Definitely Not For The Seasoned Piano Player,1376697600,08 17 2013,Bad
AKSFZ4G1AXYFC,B000068NSX,C.E. Frank,This Fender cable is the perfect length for me! Sometimes I find it a bit too long but I dont mind. The build quality is great and I know that it will last. The only gripe I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily requiring me to tighten it often.Sound quality is not affected and the color is cool definitely try this cable out.,Durable Instrument Cable,1376352000,08 13 2013,Good

A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN,B000068NSX,Charlo,Ive been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I dont mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and its holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18 cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I havent needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amps input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended there are probably better values from Hosa Monster or Planet Waves-,So far so good.  Will revisit at the 6 month mark ;),1363564800,03 18 2013,Best

A1GMWTGXW682GB,B000068NSX,MetalFan,This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. Youll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the retro look is screw on connectors over some black rubber but other than that the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. Its easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that.,Cheap and cool looking good length,1331856000,03 16 2012,Good

As they are now $6 I realize I would still be happy with that price as well as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors and work flawlessly. You must realize that they are only 5 feet as I overestimated it and now wish they were longer.

A2074KEJGRYJV4,B000068NVI,hcross,This was exactly what I was after. I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect.

A7TRK2GG6BHWD,B000068NVI,Johnny Pasta Johnny Pasta,I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show. And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself. Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place? I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational. Good price here too. Hard to find just 10 mike cords.

My son who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacement.I bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic; the sound quality is excellent.An excellent value for the money.,Excellent quality exactly what I needed,1355443200,12 14 2012,Good

A396ELNTQDFYPO,B000068NW5,Mark King,Hosa cable quality can be all over the place some of their products are good (sound good reliable long lasting) and some of their products are not good (affect sound negatively break prematurely short useful life span).These guitar cords are actually quite nice they feel good (gooey soft rubber jacket like Mogami) they sound good and so far they are working reliably the rubber jacket is about .25&#34; in diameter (by eye) and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug.I bought these when I needed cables fast for an internet concert we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up.

A781ITP3HE2N5,B000068NW5,Michael Livote dragon2knight,I never really considered a cheaper cable I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise this is an excellent cable with good build quality and a strong thick jacket that inspires confidence. The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years.

A15BHBF0L0HV1F,B000068NW5,Quaestor Raoul Duke,This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. Its quality outweighs its price. Lets face it a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential.

AQG6AQXC703WD,B000068NZC,Bob,It is a decent cable. It does its job but it leaves much to be desired as far as structural integrity is concerned. The mating part of the connector jiggles back and forth. The switch is also loose. The connector will move around 2mm out of the microphone without the switch being pressed.I would not recommend using this cable for critical applications. It would be more suited to home or hobby use.,Does Its Job,1395792000,03 26 2014,Average

A1W3CEEQBJ4GTN,B000068NZC,S. Marchuk,I bought this for my Canon Vixia HF G10 Video Camera and a Shotgun Mic that I recently purchased for it. I needed a 12&#34; wire for it to be a perfect fit from my mic (which is mounted on the Mini Advanced Shoe) to the microphone plug on the Video Camera...The wire on this thing is *not* 1 foot long. the actual wire is under 8&#34; long itself. I would have returned this thing but it was cheap enough that it wasnt worth the hassle... Id have rated it 1 star but I tried it on my Nikon D3200 (Shoe mounted Shotgun Mike) and it worked out ok. Still a tight fit though (since theres only 8&#34; of wire)...Id recommend anyone looking for a short cable go with a 2 adapter; worst case scenario you can zip-tie a loop instead of getting angry that it doesnt fit.Also not sure if its the wire (so this didnt affect stars) but I hear a hiss when recording. Again; unsure if its the way the wires are stretched out to the max on the DSLR or not (or my shotgun mic).,Measure your damned wires before sending them...,1379289600,09 16 2013,Bad

A1IR3NR4KRPIJ1,B000068NZG,Jason Lewis,The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire.,Product shipd as expected but the listing for this item can be confusing,1371686400,06 20 2013,Best
A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B000068NZG,Mike Tarrani Jazz Drummer,First the reasons why I awarded this five stars: the construction is uniformly excellent. Both ends have strain reliefs the 1/8 connecter perfectly mates with the plug into which I insert it and the XLR end is a quality component.I purchased this specifically to transform the third channels in myPowerwerks 50 Watt Personal P.A. Systeminto something more useable. This greatly expands the functionality and versatility of the portable PA by allowing me to plug in another mic. Since I have three of those units daisychained I was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapter.Another reason why I love this is its noise free. In some environments in which I play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit. I have not had that problem with this one so its another plus.Overall I am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case I damage or lose my primary one. Its a bit pricier than others I considered but I feel that the quality and peace of mind are worth the premium.,Solved a big issue for me,1372118400,06 25 2013,Best

A34IJACMU8C3IM,B000068NZG,Rob W. Sounddude,This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First its construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be gentle with it when using it. Thats something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable heavy duty and with a longer cable for the same price.

A2WYF4POBUXL2O,B000068NZG,TriggerHappy,Well made. Works as it should. However seem to be getting a little bit of noise from a shotgun mic straight into a D800.

If you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables theyre listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another.

Just not what I needed in my particular situation.,Nice tool although not a transformer balancing device,1392076800,02 11 2014,Good
A9J03MF2689TS,B000068O4H,D. WALTER,I use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake to change 1 channel into my monitor return. I plug an XLR to Female 1/4 stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup. Now I can record with 6 channels and monitor with 2. (Its an 8 channel XLR snake). Why do I go through all that you ask? because I have an 8 channel XLR snake and instead of buying another snake why not ADAPT the snake I have? hence the word adapter... :-P I love it. Its a great tool to add versatility to your setup no matter what youre doing. Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 1/4 stereo... Its high quality and very solid I definately expect this to last me a long time.,Versatility...,1326240000,01 11 2012,Best

A1M957IA3QNX7X,B000068O4H,Kyle D.,This converts an xlr signal (for me a Shure SM57 mic) into a 1/4 male (I run it into a guitar pedalboard and then an amp).

A3HLW3G0TA8GX1,B000068O59,Andytoy,I bought this XLR splitter to split the lead vocal from FOH to my monitor rack.  Used this way it worked great and I never had any problems with signal loss or power issues.  I began using a transformer isolated XLR splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter.  My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singers microphone.  It would be great on a guitar mic or something thats close to the ground or horizontally placed but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand.,Nice utility wish it had a little more length on the split cable,1392076800,02 11 2014,Good

A2RS66Y79Q8X0W,B000068O59,Rexomus One man with courage makes a majority.,This Dual splitter works perfect. I own a live event video company and I shoot a lot of weddings. The most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. I always say half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJs mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though the signal is to hot the music is crap or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJs voice I can edit the way I want and compress time. This product has improved my productions beyond its price sold. I use them to run a separate clean audio line from a DJs wireless systems to my own audio recorder. They work perfectly and havent failed me once.,Great Product for running a clean separate line of audio,1396310400,04 1 2014,Best

He was right.  Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 6.0 amp.  Also fixed the effects loop jacks which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs.  Not good!  After several gigs worth of testing both problems are resolved!

A6FIAB28IS79,B00009W40D,Samuel Chell,As a freelancer I occasionally work with a band that plays the Midwest performing on a near-weekly basis.  These are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet.  Its all about money to them.  I couldnt believe it when I first saw the group using these Nady mics (even lower-priced several years ago) and insisting they were as good as Shure SM-57s and 58s.  I still dont believe the quality of workmanship compares (any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much).  But these Nadys handle the announcing the vocals and when needed the softer sounding instruments (flute harmonica) and none has broken or quit on my watch.Im a keyboardist so mic power and fidelity dont affect me.  Im only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important gear component.  At the same time my embarrassment I confess is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee.  After all whos playing--and getting paid for it?,Good enough for professional use,1244332800,06 7 2009,Good

While not the best quality cable the length and price make it a good value for the money especially if youre buying several at a time.  I dont use these cables in the studio but for live theyre fine.  Id recommend this cable if youre on a budget and looking to buy several at a time.

A10KH8EN77ZKWH,B00009W40G,H. Easter,I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. Its a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I dont expect a lot of movement (e.g. running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldnt use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.Theyre cheap and they work fine. I havent noticed any sound issues at all.,Cheap works; strong butyl rubber smell thin cable.,1330992000,03 6 2012,Good

A2N4QZ92NBKJZZ,B0000AQRSR,Phaeton,4 stars instead of 5 only because this thing wont tune your guitar or carry your amp. I use this solo in a duo with a bass player in a trio with drums and bass. I have a regular gig at a medium sized club that is basically one large room. I use it through a Pyle Pro self contained Pa into which I also plug my Martin GRP elec/acoustic. The sound quality is excellent. The volume seems limited only bny what the Pyle Pro will put out. I would have no hesitation using this for bigger rooms with a full band and PA. I havent heard a hint of feedback and the on/off switch is a plus.The 36.99 price might seem to good to be true but think of the things for which we are paying less for than we used to. I bought a 32&#34; Toshiba flat screen for around 230 bucks Think of what that would have cost even five years ago or less. The same is true of a lot of Audio Gear. A lot of companies are bringing high quality elctronics and music to the market but its great to have a company like Shure make something so good and so affordable. They have always made a high quality product and now they have one that almost anyone can afford. I cannot recommend it strongly enough.,Buy This!,1386374400,12 7 2013,Good

A2MR43RDPZX3J,B0000AQRSS,Applewhite Minyard,It is so hard to get an honest review of any mike that isnt a Shure SM58. This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured. Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound. I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s. I was considering the SM48 but the PG58 has slightly better specs and almost identical price.The first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. It also has a different switch than the SM58. The metal screens protecting them arent interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. I tried both mikes one after the other first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar and then I changed the settings or more specifically the effects and the EQ on the PA. I repeated the experiment speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.Heres what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. They are about equal on volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls. Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.I havent tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice as its too time consuming and interferes with playing. Its difficulty to judge in those situations too or at least awkward but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58 but that could be just the settings.I looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response especially at the high end over 10K Hz and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58 somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz neither of these seems likely to have much effect although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.I also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued though and replaced with the 1800XM an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.I then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup not even taken out for practice. The model number is 33-3001 probably also discontinued. This was an excellent sounding mike with good volume presence and tone.I didnt have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment but I did reach some conclusions:There is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable at around $100. However there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable at lower prices including the Shure PG58 and most likely the SM48 though I didnt have any of those to test.I wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. Im giving this 4 stars only because I havent had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58.,Unbiased review,1401062400,05 26 2014,Good
A3VVKC910FN4EK,B0000AQRSS,David Basham,This microphone is great for singing with a PA and an electric guitar.

This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it. My next one will be an SM58 but that will be awhile from now. Im very happy with this PG58.Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider. It would keep me from buying another one of these. Other mics I own dont have this problem to this degree.,Good Mic,1251849600,09 2 2009,Good
A6FIAB28IS79,B0000AQRSS,Samuel Chell,I started with the Shure PG58 and most recently acquired the Shure SM58.  Id probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 Gs simply isnt that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks.  But with respect to the Shure Im less sure that the SM58 isnt worth 40% more than the PG58.  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and clean amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice the two mics could be mistaken for one another.  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58.  Switching to the more common admittedly more expensive mic gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).P.S. I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58.  Since the rise of the digital audio workstation (who doesnt have a computer with free included Garage Band on it?) large even gold-plated expensive-looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place.  Despite appearances when it comes to mics size doesnt matter--except for appearances (directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap half-way around the face knowing that the girls in the front-line think theyre cool--they look just like Madonnaa or Janets headgear).

A2KI91IR3RA7D0,B0000AQRST,David L. Vasser,Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic that was not always the case and Ive actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a Shure Model 545 Unidyne III.  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function.  Ive owned or used countless modern day SM-58s and SM-57s along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I dont need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  Id only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58s require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57s.  I prefer the SM-57s over the SM-58s for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic Ive ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals Id recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days.  I cant find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However if youve ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals Id use an SM-7 which really doesnt sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and its predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.  You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen.,Best all around for over 30 years!,1147651200,05 15 2006,Best

This is a great all purpose dynamic mic I use it for instruments vocals even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals but that doesnt mean that the 57 cant handle a voice.  Theyre pretty much the same mic as far as Im concerned and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think youll find the same thing.  And if youre operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably then you probably already know what youre looking for.  Ill be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon but if youre like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics you cant go wrong here.,Its an SM57 whats there to say?,1363737600,03 20 2013,Best

A34IJACMU8C3IM,B0000AQRST,Rob W. Sounddude,Considering that the SM57 was introduced to the world in 1967 a year after the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone I guess the 58 gets Batman status relegating the 57 to that of Robin. But thats not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time and except for the 58s acoustic foam lined cage pop screen the two mics are identical electrically.The SM (Studio Microphone) 57 was designed to begin its life in a recording studio as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers drum kits etc. In that capacity it had no use for the pop screen of its cousin the SM58 still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day. So the SM57 slimmed down and even though its still a fine vocal mic youll see it used mostly micing instruments which it excels at.One of its long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the White House. A pair of SM57s is always seen on various White House podiums for press conferences and there is even a VIP bundled kitShure SM57 VIP Dual Microphone Kityou can buy for this exact type of use.The SM57 is an extremely rugged mic built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse. Thats one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies. And on top of that its just a great sounding mic for the price.There is a Performer SeriesShure Beta 57A Microphonethat looks very similar to the SM57 but the Beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different. So make sure you try before you buy.Bottom line is the Shure SM57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced.

A3AOB0VF6H0IF4,B0000AQRSU,Daits,It is not a bad mic for the price ( If you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks) but it is no comparison to a studio mic since I have worked in a recording studio. Now you need to decide what you want getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for; it is like having HD TV and BD player but playing an ordinary CD. You would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer speakers and so on. If you are a home or hobby user then go for this mic. This mic is quite good for its price. I would probably say it exceeds your expectations.Arrived as promised in a frustration free packing.

A2KI91IR3RA7D0,B0000AQRSU,David L. Vasser,The first rule of microphones is that No one microphone is perfect for every purpose.  Rule two is Experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound.  Ive used Shure SM58s along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968.  I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used (and still do use) them for singing some back up vocals.The SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use.  Some people me included actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic the Shure SM-57.  The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice.  For example anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58.  People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.The SM-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect (which means the bass increases the closer you get.)  This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away.  The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they dont sound right.  On the other hand the SM-57 sounds best several inches away from the users mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away.  While the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly.  It works ok for conga drums and the like but the SM-58 is about the last thing youd want to use to mic a sax or guitar.  Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice but for some people they sound great.  The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen.  However for other people the SM-58 works better.  It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do.  If you have a very deep voice the SM-58 might be the second best choice after the SM-57 which has a better low frequency response.One certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability.  This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal.  Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available (at a slight extra cost) with a built-in on/off switch.  The SM-58s ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars.  Ive seen SM-58s dented rusty dusty smoked up spit into with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet Ive never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on/off switch that got dirt in it.All the pro-line Shure mics are top quality.  The pro line Shures also hold their value well.  If you buy one and decide you dont like it you can get about what you paid for it on eBay.  I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one.  Senneheisers EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look. The SM-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice.  These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today theyd still be around for another 20 years at least.,Good for vocals only!,1147737600,05 16 2006,Good

I depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds I like perfectly.  You can stand 3 feet away and really wail or get up close for some bass response or anything in between.The SM58-CN comes with the mic 25-ft cable cable tie carry pouch and mic clip.

A34IJACMU8C3IM,B0000AQRSU,Rob W. Sounddude,In the immortal words that John Cameron Swayze used when hawking his Timex watches during the early days of live television the Shure SM58 Vocal mic fits perfectly into that same category.Before I found a career as a film and television sound recordist and mixer I played in rock bands and did live sound mixing. One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58. Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966 the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible.The mic capsule is of cardiord (heart shaped) design which helps reject sound from either side. There is a 4K bump in its frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise. Construction is rugged frequency response is 50 to 15000 Hz and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise.We used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldnt find one just grab one of these they are that tough. Ive seen some of these on the road that you couldnt believe still worked but they did and sounded great.The cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only its distinctive look one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced but its part of the functionality. Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element. As a frame of reference theShure SM57LC Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphoneis the same exact mic and capsule but without the pop screen.Shure also sells a Performer series mic theShure Beta 58A Supercardioid Dynamic Microphonethat looks almost identical to the SM58 but uses a totally different mic capsule and transformer and has a different sound so try before you buy.The Shure SM58 is still considered the industry standard of live performance mics today and for the price they really are a good deal.,Takes A Licking And Keeps On Ticking,1229126400,12 13 2008,Good
A6FIAB28IS79,B0000AQRSU,Samuel Chell,I made the mistake of thinking I could save forty bucks and get by with the Shure PG-58.  Im no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a P.A.). Whatever the reason the PG-58 simply doesnt have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube / Peavey amps I try to employ it with (I use a 1/4 adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic).  When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone the difference is instant and dramatic--its a far more efficient (i.e. louder) mic producing a full clear sound and without additional pre-amplification demonstrating why its the most popular microphone in the world.  For five bucks extra I cant fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S the version with an on-off switch.  Its a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of private comments by indiscreet band members.  And even if youre an instrumentalist it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57.  The former mic is a little more ostentatious but its also slightly more adaptable and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. Above all the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability.[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of this seller.  Perhaps a good point unless its in reference to Amazon Prime which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices no postage easy returns.  But anyone who returns an SM58 probably had no business buying it in the first place.  They are the populous drones of the industry invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what theyre getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility.  In fact its the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators.  Consumers require choice but with the Shure SM58 there need be none.],A Shure Bet.,1245110400,06 16 2009,Best

A203OCQQ12MAVT,B000165DSM,HMMWV God Country Corps,Everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another.  I have a personal preference for the XLR ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside (first to slide down the cable) with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters.  Unfortunately that design isnt used here but I chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15 of good quality shielded cable with 2 XLR ends (M and F) for well under $1/ft.As for pinout its straightforward pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends.  The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which I havent had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineers kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arises.Another favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above which amazon will rush you:GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3 Balanced Snake Cord - 6 PACK- these are very easy to open an end change phase lift ground or input someones oddball source signal.  Having 6 on hand means you wont quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix.Back to pyles product here I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since its 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot.  Its also great when someone yells its too short I need a cable stretcher at the podium! and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasnt planned for or got moved/quit working.  For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing.I finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA 1/4 TRS hi-z transformers and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems and a roll of gaffers tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards.  I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit. With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2.5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin.  Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on so a bit of what if thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owners daughers toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.My last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made.  It will no doubt be needed again and since you made it youll know why how and where it was used before thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem.  People think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position.  My only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didnt serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted XLR 4 pin stereo Y splitter to dual TRS female cable I made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry.  I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console.,This gets 5 stars for value but doesnt use my favorite XLR end,1272326400,04 27 2010,Best

AOINAOO0NQRGN,B000165DSM,Sessue,I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires of course the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. Ive had similar problems with other Pyle products.

AGYH5U11ZKPFB,B0002BACB4,kannibul,I have one of these as well as several other microphones. The SM58 is a good all around mic - the reason its an industry standard/go-to but the Beta 58A is a better (in my opinion) vocal-specific mic...basically giving (again in my opinion) a higher quality sound. The SM58 by comparison sounds muffled/muddy where the Beta58A is clearer stronger and more articulate. If youre used to the SM58 then the Beta58A can sound thin and harsh but that is adjustable at the board - end result is that its a tighter sounding mic with more clarity.Pattern-wise it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds - I play drums and use this mic for that reason is that it picks up less of my drums than a SM57 or a SM58.,Built like a hammer.

Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews. When I received it I cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah..

A17A1KTVI3DG6U,B0002BACB4,Nathan A. Edwards,While the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship the Beta 58A needs to be given its due. The Beta 58A is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin. That is the Beta 58A in the confined live scenarios in which I have utilized it has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues. For vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high (or really any) notes the Beta is a dream. This same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or popping complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it.While I wish that I had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon I can confidently say that the Beta 58A is the best vocals microphone that I have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment. Quite honestly I would not be at all surprised if the Beta compared well even in confined recording situations. The bottom line is that the Beta 58A might be more expensive than its popular cousin the SM58 but it is worth every penny. Anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority. Six out of five stars!,Beyond fantastic!,1248134400,07 21 2009,Best
A2Z89YMZZJWBHS,B0002BACB4,Sunn Kram,The Beta 58A along with the original SM58 are industry standards thats well known. As a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there. Quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go-to house mics. In fact I noticed Betas all over the place at a small theater (with a high-end system) that I played at just recently.I had used the old 58 for years before moving to the Beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two. The Beta is definitetly hotter with a more sensitive response. Your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to. Mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close. You definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight. This is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected.Built like a tank is probably a bit overused when describing products but Shures vocal mics truly earn that title. They can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter. Toss it around drop it bury it under other stuff etc. NO problem. When you are maintaining a bunch of music gear its nice to have tools that you never worry about. For that reason Id highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal. Chances are its in working order no matter what.,Rock Solid,1327449600,01 25 2012,Best
A1ARFA1NCN34UV,B0002CZR3G,almost I,I actually replaced a BOSS TR2 with this pedal. Does everything it is supposed to do without the perceived (thats was they say) volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals. If its perceived then how do you explain how good this sounds?

A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN,B0002CZR3G,Charlo,Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Dano stomp boxes.  I probably own close to a dozen of from the various lines they make.  This pedal does a decent job covering your tremolo needs but IMHO the tremolo from Danos Cool Cat line is a much more durable pedal for only $4 more (at the time of this review).  The switches and knobs on this pedal are the weak link.  I dont think its true bypass either.  The Cool Cat has a metal enclosure true bypass sturdier inputs and knobs and a much better on/off switch.  The features and sound are the same.  Spend the extra $4 and you will have a much more bullet-proof pedal with the Cool Cat trem.,Not bad but the Cool Cat line is $4 more and a better build,1364515200,03 29 2013,Average

A3CR1EV98GQ87X,B0002CZR3G,Paul S. Brzozowski Tennessee,When I first started setting up my little studio I wanted something that didnt break the budget.  I tried a couple different combo pedal boards (Digitech 500 Boss ME-70) but quickly realized I wasnt getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up.  With not much left I tried a Tuna Melt as an example of Danelectro.  Who would think?  This thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds as are most of this line of pedals.  I now own about 12-14 of these of all types and have never been dissapointed save its very hard to chain them without a lot of noise.Then I got into guitar building and they all got put away.  Lately I have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills and joy of joys! I am rediscovering all these pedals and I absolutely love them.Forget the FAB series they are not so hot.

A56EP6FFRH1YT,B0002CZSJO,J. Kim,I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo Ive come across doesnt require tension adjustment and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second its smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because its designed to work across the fretboard it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby.,Quickest changing capo,1250985600,08 23 2009,Good

AEN6KDJ3AJDK6,B0002CZSJO,Patrick M. Waters,This style of capo CAN throw your guitar out of tune if you dont put it on right. When used correctly though it does its job just fine.,Its a capo,1375142400,07 30 2013,Best
AOINAOO0NQRGN,B0002CZSJO,Sessue,I can only repeat what everyone else has already said: this Kyser capo is designed and built very well. Its easy to put on and adjust and just as easy to take off. There are probably a few capos out there that are a bit flashier but this is still pretty stylish. And the price makes it a real bargain.,And all together now...,1330473600,02 29 2012,Best
A26E1V45R24QVC,B0002CZSJY,ccaptn,I dont believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo but this one is quite good.  For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use.  It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built.  It is as with all capos  important to take it off when not in use so the rubber does not get grooved.  This is just good common sense.  If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another.,Good effective capo,1287100800,10 15 2010,Good

A2FGSRTR4XFHMC,B0002CZSJY,Jonah Koonce,I am very pleased with this purchase. The strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets.

A27UAE2PME5TRV,B0002CZSJY,kwb,Long time Shubb user but decided to try something different.I think Ive found how lazy I am. I ended up using the Kyser more often than the Shubb because of the fact that you can put the Kyser on the peghead.Reaching my hand to an always available position on guitars (i.e. the peghead) for the Kyser turns out to be much more convenient than reaching to something that is not on the guitar and that could change according to situations e.g. maybe just by my side on the sofa in my living room maybe a table or the floor in some other places for the Shubb.,Convenience won,1294444800,01 8 2011,Best

A3V1A3C9DTLPME,B0002CZSJY,Peter Faden robilar5500,I have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently. The price is right for these and they work just fine. My only real issue is that sometimes they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret youre going to bar thus producing a sound you werent looking for. Some of the higher end capos counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring. However like i say these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard and are from what i can tell the most popular model on the market.,They work pretty well.,1310774400,07 16 2011,Good
A2D9QW4TY8CFB0,B0002CZSJY,Philip Gardner,Easy to use capo. Good strength - holds the strings down well..

A3BH9XC0BVO1AG,B0002CZSJY,snocyclist,I really like my capo the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic and it works as it should. However I feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product. For example I think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer and rounded (the back side of a guitar neck is rounded after all). The spring could definitely be tighter...I do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough. Also the design is fairly nice but its mostly aesthetic...its not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily.Dont get me wrong this is a rather good product and its priced about right. It just isnt a high end product/5-star perfect.,Works well looks nice minor complaints,1335052800,04 22 2012,Good

A34G1GTMQGEDUN,B0002CZT0M,Johanna Livingstone Honest Reviewer,I am yet another one of those Forever Beginners when it comes to playing the guitar. Never mind that...these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better! After putting in new pegs and re-stringing with these strings...it sounds so much nicer! More richer! Now I see I need to replace the saddle and bridge on it as the pegs keep coming loose. I think that once I do this and then re-string these same strings on it...I will be set to go!I like that these strings are light as due to not having had much practice for a number of years...lets face it...my fingers get sore when playing! I also have small fingers and hands.I intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use.I recommend!,Love these guitar strings!,1364169600,03 25 2013,Best

A22SZV0N4O2FQM,B0002CZTIO,Amazon Customer remo,I bought this pick holder because I hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you cant play with a pick in your strings. I originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock. Boy was I wrong. The picture is misleading.  This thing is tiny and barely goes across three string. It wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks (maybe more if they are thin) into the wedges on top. Stays in place well and is very convenient.Only negative is I dont know how long it will hold up. I think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better. I can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks.,Nice little pick holder,1288828800,11 4 2010,Good
A1QE7VZE507TO7,B0002CZTIO,Brian Hogan Dog person,I really like these things.

A2VCXIAWCPQ13P,B0002CZTIO,Renbutsu,Not too much to say its made out of foam made to slip between the strings made to hold two picks.  I have several of these for acoustics and for electrics.  My son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it wont be dislodged still it does stay on majority of the time.  I do recommend this.  My sons guitar teacher calls this a fancy little pick holder and Ive had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time.  One must also be careful my son lost one of these so I know it is a possibility of it falling off.  He lost it after performing in a play on stage.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews and leave a comment if you have any questions I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.,Its a wedgie,1346198400,08 29 2012,Good

AGDWVRFL81B4O,B0002CZTIO,tekHedd tekHedd,I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar as I often find myself playing with fingers then suddenly a pick song starts and... wheres a pick? I usually have to offset it and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it but the spreading strings on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So still highly recommended if your headstock has a straight through design not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) ),Back to order more,1308960000,06 25 2011,Best

A1TSW5IJ1LU0RP,B0002CZTIO,wishbone73,I was thinking it may affect the ability to tune properly but it seems to have no affect at all. Super audiophile tone hounds might say it affects the resonance and sustain but just take it off when recording. Very handy to have two picks with you at all times. Its great not to have to make a trip back to the mike stand to get a pick or having to attach something with sticky tape to the guitars finish. Me likey!!

ASJAKT8DJIAC5,B0002CZTIO,YetAnotherITGuy Chris,I bought one of these to try on my Asher Junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick. Worked but it was difficult getting all three picks in one Wedgie so I ordered a second one. Between the two of them between the 2nd/3rd and 4th/5th strings up next to the nut works pretty good holding these types of picks (which admittedly the Wedgie was not actually designed for). Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). Only down side I see is -- they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar (havent tried it yet). But otherwise worth the price and a good doo-dad to have around. Especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself (real help to me staying organized!).,great for my lap steel guitar!,1339718400,06 15 2012,Good
AN1RO6C6I78YO,B0002CZUTM,B. T. Corneto BeeTeeCee,Ive played string instruments for the better part of 55 years... Starting with a cheap Tijuana Wood box as a 5 year old progressing to Martin 6 and 12 string Acoustic guitars and a few electric Fender and Gibson units.... All good in their own respect.I decided to treat myself to a Les Paul for my 58th birthday but not having the financial resources to buy a $3000.00 git I shopped and shopped... Finally settling on this Cherry Burst LP-100.It arrived in perfect condition the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding. It was even sorta in tune... but a quick dial-in with the electronic tuner brought that right.Simply put Nice guitar. After allowing the strings and neck to settle in together I spent a few hours a week later adjusting string height intonation and pick-up distances and now this LP *ROCKS* !!!If youre going to spend mid-range $$$ on a fine practice / performance guitar you cant go wrong with this one kids - Two Thumbs Up ![Suggestion: A Fender Mustang 1 or 2 amp makes this guitar sound even better...],A Very Good Selection,1339804800,06 16 2012,Best

A20L3BCRCICRSQ,B0002CZUTM,Jake,This is a fine guitar but it isnt amazing.  My particular instrument has some issues with the finish in a couple of places around the perimeter of the guitar - they look like black splotches underneath the sunburst paint and clear-coat.  Theres one near the top strap post and another near the place where the pick-guard mounts to the underside of the body.  Neither would be apparent to someone who wasnt appraising the guitar but they are there and dont look normal to me.  Maybe I got the first one off the line after they switched from black-painted models?  My guitar also has a weird V shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesnt match at all - Im guessing that its a joint that has been glued together.  I know that the better Les Paul guitars have a one-piece neck and since I didnt read about this one having something different I assumed it would be the same.  Glue is stronger than wood and Les Paul guitars have a tendency to break in that area so I guess my guitar should be more durable than some. Still it was a disappointing and unexpected discovery.  Im not sure that seeing these finish issues before-hand wouldve dissuaded me from buying the same guitar but upon reflection it wouldve been much smarter to visit a music store and examine the guitar before buying.My remaining issues with the instrument have more to do with the general design of all Les Paul guitars versus my particular instrument.  The guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap even while sitting.  The top strap peg is angled up slightly where guitars with horns have them angled down which means that investing in the install of a straplock system of some kind is a good idea with a Les Paul - the pegs just dont stay in the strap holes as well as on some other guitars.  Its great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that &#34;real&#34; Les Paul guitars do but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup.  The range of adjustment on the saddles is pretty small and I found it impossible to setup the guitar for coated .09 strings without additional hardware.The guitar sounds decent it looks pretty great (although not quite as pretty as the pictured one) and due to its shorter scale length it is a tad easier to play than some other guitars.  Note: the shorter scale length is characteristic of Les Paul guitars it doesnt indicate that this is less than a &#34;full-sized&#34; guitar.  Though this is a fine guitar for the price Im not sure that I would make the same choice if I were in the same position again.,My mistake for buying sight unseen.,1392854400,02 20 2014,Average
A3G5BIFX6VS1OP,B0002CZUTM,jeff h,I have been playing guitar for over 30 years. Ive owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime. My wife bought this guitar for me as a gift. I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this guitar. It is a solid well built guitar. The finish is beautiful. The pictures do it no justice. It sounds incredible. It has great tone and sustain wonderful harmonics. The clean tones are nice and warm. The neck is fast. No fret noise or hums. The pickups are really nice. Its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it. From blues to hard rock & metal. I would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat. You cannot find a better guitar for this price. I would have expected it to cost much more. I am extremely impressed with this great guitar. You can bet when I add the next guitar to my collection it will be another epiphone. Well done Epiphone!!,Fantastic guitar,1388793600,01 4 2014,Best
A31RULW0KNYJ5H,B0002CZUTM,LA,I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. After doing research reading reviews and checking it out in a guitar store I chose this one.Its much easier to play than the Squier and it has a better sound. Like the Squier (but not as bad) it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted but I dont have a clue as to how to go about it.Its also a good choice for women. Im a small woman and I really like that the neck is smaller. Its also fairly lightweight.Overall Im happy with my choice. A guitar tech told me its the best guitar out there under $500. Maybe. I expect to be happy with it for a few years before I upgrade again.,Good for When Youre Ready for Your Second Guitar,1358294400,01 16 2013,Good
AG5L0MYSPPWDC,B0002CZUTM,Mano,I bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and I couldnt be happier.  This was my first electric and after over a year of owning it I got a way more expensive Fender Strat and I still prefer how this Epiphone feels; it is really lightweight a lot more that even other Les Pauls and the distance between frets is smaller than the one in other guitars I have tried this makes it VERY easy to play it stays in tune and it looks really REALLY lovely.I like it so much that I decided to add a pair of Slashs Alnico IIs on it that cost more than the guitar itself this only made it sound incredibly awesome and improve the sustain good ol crunchy-bluessy rock.Call me cheap if you want and I wouldnt care this is one of those items that makes you wonder how come theres others way more overpriced and just dont find a way to justify that a real Gibson Les Paul will sound $800 - $1000 better.It wasnt until recently (after 3 years - I estimate somewhere around 1000 hours of heavy use) that it started fretting and thats why I gave it only 4 stars; but what would you expect from a $200 guitar...?  Im sure this can be easily fixed by any guitar tech and it will continue been the sweet-tone machine it has always been.  If youre learning looking for a first electric or just want a practice axe that will not dissapoint you just go ahead and buy it dont give it a 2nd thought and do it.,First electric guitar,1395273600,03 20 2014,Good
A1SG6JGU7ISEH3,B0002CZUTM,Nunya Bizness,I have been playing guitar since I was 6 years old (over 3 decades) and I must say this was a very pleasant surprise.  I havent had an electric in years and didnt have the budget to get a Gibson so picked up this Epi Les Paul 100 instead along with a Fender Mustang I Amp.  Great combination.  This guitar has a very sloid feel and came set-up perfectly right out of the box.  All it needed was tuning.  Unlike others I didnt feel that the strings I got needed to be changed right away but probably within the first two weeks you will want to change them.  Replaced mine with Ernie Ball Not Even Slinkys and couldnt be happier with the way this thing plays and sounds.  Great sustain beautiful harmonics the clean tones are warm can get nice blues tones out of it and superb thrash metal too.  Very versatile.  It does not quiet do country or jazz but it wasnt really meant to.The action is extremely easy fret board has a great feel to it good width on the neck not too slinder but not too thick.  It just feels good in your hands.The finish on this product is very nice.  One thing though the pick guard is kind of a tan / cream off white color not bright white as pictured but it still looks great.Also not mentioned in the description but this does come with a 12 foot cord but its not the best quality.  Would recommend picking up a new one when you order.Overall this is well worth the $500 that they list as the MSRP.  At less than half that its a steal.If you are considering this instrument dont hesitate.,Quality guitar at a great price.,1326931200,01 19 2012,Best
AVDW3OAVWWE05,B0002CZUTM,Skyeye,Well the Epiphone Les Paul came in earlier this morning!Am I impressed? U bet cha!This thing is simply beautiful! It arrived well padded in a double box. Initially I spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if I could spot any flaws. NONE! Not a finger print on it anywhere! This guitar is extremely well made and put together right. It was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter. The neck is slim (which is good for my thick hands) and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities. I put a quarter under the 10th. fret and its right on the &#34;money&#34;!Its considerably heaver than than I thought.  I would imagine it weighs about 10-14lbs. I have a strap ordered and on the way.The maple top is a work of art with a superior finish. All the metal hardware appears top quality as are the Duncan pickups. This Epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing I ever had.

AMU3EIC4EOPX4,B0002CZUTM,Sweed,Waited two months before reviewing my les paul 100 to make sure there were no issues.  I am very happy with the guitar.  It came well padded and was in excellent shape.  It was set up well and has played well out of the box.  Just did my first string change making sure I used the same gauge of string and didnt have to make any adjustments to the guitar.  Played as well after the change as it did before.  Was a little nervous about an online purchase and not being able to play the guitar before buying but when you live out in the sticks and its a major trip to get to a real guitar store you sometimes take your chances.  Anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play free prime two day shipping no sales tax and saved about $80 in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store.  The savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new Mustang 2 v2 amplifier.The only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box.  This one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer.  It is not a big deal to me but I thought Id mention it for those thinking of buying a epiphone.  When I ordered this one I wasnt really sure if a cable would be included or not so I ordered one at the same time Im glad I did.,very happy with my les paul,1376870400,08 19 2013,Best
ATL0URQ0KUKGZ,B0002CZUUG,CRS71,First off the shipping was fantastic. It shipped the very next day and came VERY well protected in perfect condition. It is an extremely well made and solid product. I think a few people have given this Les Paul a rep of just being a Starter Guitar. Trust me when I say I have no problem leaving my Les Paul Standard at home and taking this one to a gig. It plays well and the sound?? INCREDIBLE. It even has a great acoustic sound to it when not plugged into an amp. I cant say enough good things about this guitar its that good.

A3DIN9E5QQZ6VT,B0002CZUUG,Dakotah Jennings,Itd been about 6 years since Ive had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I dont have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs which Ill likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP.

A15TYOEWBQYF0X,B0002CZUUG,David W Dave,I am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up dial it in and play it for a while.  I edited yet again as someone didnt appreciate my gloating over other guitars I own.  Sorry to offend YOU.I made a knee jerk review (again) right after I got this.  But in all fairness I received my Gibson Les Paul on the same day buying IT from my local music store and professionally set up ready to go.  I was comparing apples and oranges so to speak.  But now even after comparing them to each other they really arent that far apart.The Gibson is the best guitar Ive ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it.  But this little baby is now my second favorite.My other review was NOT FAIR!!!!!!  I paid a lot more for the Gibson and 149 bucks for this Epiphone.  Dollar for dollar this little Ephiphone is a steal!!!!  WOW!!!I must honestly admit the edge goes to my Gibson but not by as much as youd think.  This little Epiphone is an outstanding guitar regardless of price.  If I were to play them each blindfolded I would never guess one was $149 guitar ever!  The tone of the Epiphone is much like the Gibson Les Paul.  Its easy to play comfortable and has a sweet sound.  I can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock.To be honest I will probably play this Epiphone a LOT more than the Gibson.  After all if I ding this one up I havent broke the bank.  I think Ill tend to use this one a lot more than the other.I am very happy with this Epiphone Les Paul and will proudly play and OWN it.  I am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge.  I may purchase another one and put it away as Im sure the price wont stay this low.  PLUS Ill get another one in a different color!!  You can never have too many guitars..  I am going to an a pickguard to this one.  The finish on it is outstanding and Id like to keep it that way.If I were thinking of learning to play the guitar this one is a no-brainer....BUY IT!!!If youre an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar Id buy this one is a heartbeat.  I was shocked at how sweet it sounds how good it looks how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays.  Sure it was way out of tune and required a few height adjustments but now it is FANTASTIC.New rule for me no writing reviews until I own the product for at least one week!!!!!,After a proper set-up 5 stars  Damn nice guitar,1390521600,01 24 2014,Best

A3IVULXGE2PB43,B0002CZUUG,Jeffro,Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar EbonyHello again. I have written a review on this guitar just after I purchased it and now its been over a year and I still stand by my positive review. I own about 8 guitars now and this guitar is one of two of my favorites. My other favorite is a Dean electric 12 string.  When I hold and play this Epiphone Les Paul special 2 guitar it feels and sounds like something I could take on stage but it doesnt have the cost associated with a Gibson. Whats also amazing is that its still around a $150. Its well worth the noney. It stays in tune and it high quality. Well worth the money. I just purchased an electric/acoustic Epiphone ukelele today for my Chiropractor. I will review that later. If you are looking for a Les Paul guitar this is not one. Not his typical style although Amazon does sell one for about $250 so dont let the name fool you. Its still a very nice guitar though. Very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners. I highly recommend this guitar. Buy it!  Thank you.,Well-made plays well.,1370908800,06 11 2013,Best
A2MMH4O7EDNLCV,B0002CZUUG,jerkowitz,Ive been playing for over 40 years. I currently own 60 or so guitars. My problem with LPs is they feel like a boat anchor around your neck Ive bought and sold quite a few. Another problem with real LPs you only get one chance to drop one just see how many used ones have head-stock repairs. They ARE beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play. I deal in used guitars picked up an Epi Special ll along with several other guitars at a resale shop for very cheap. I didnt mess with it until I was ready to set it up for resale. I fully expect to do a fret level on most guitars even a lot of higher end guitars need it. I found on the Special ll the frets were actually very well done (Chinese version from 2011) and only needed a slight leveling (would have played fine without it but I am very picky). It didnt take much to get it set up small truss rod adjustment new set of 10s for strings. little bit of adjustment to the bridge cut the nut a bit....note it played well the way I got it just like my stuff perfect. Got it set-up and plugged it in to check the electronics and thats when I started to really become impressed with this guitar. Cheap pickups are supposed to sound muddy with no character these sounded pretty good actually very good nice and bright with a nice tight bottom end. I check sound also by cranking up a backing track to stage level and playing a few tracks. It cut through really well. I noticed while doing this test that the volume had a very nice sweep to it and didnt lose any highs when turned down. The tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep very nice. I popped off the back cover to check what was in there full sized pots maybe not the best quality but much better than expected. I normally upgrade electronics on my personal guitars to get the controls to operate the way I like but no need to fix whats not broken. Yup I said on my personal guitars because I am keeping this one for myself. The neck is very fast and comfy its NOT a boat anchor so my shoulder will thank me. The tuners are the lower end trapezoid type but turn smoothly with no backlash and keep the guitar in tune fine once again if it aint broke dont fix it. Please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut. Ive set-up hundreds of guitars and almost all of them need nut work doesnt matter what price point you are at. This also has a bolt on neck. A lot of players say you have to have a set (glued) neck. I feel glue actually deadens the sound a bit I prefer a good solid bolt on to transfer sound IMO. I have found that the quality level of the low end foreign guitars has become very good. I know that corners have to be cut to get to the price point of these budget guitars but all in all the Special ll is good to go right out of the box with just a little tweaking. My advice is to go try one my taste may not be the same as yours. There are a lot of good value well made guitars now-a-days I just found at this price vs quality ratio the Epiphone Special ll really is special. Get one get it set up for a few bucks if you cant do it yourself and you will have a good instrument. Oh did I mention this is a very good looking guitar?,Good Value LP,1355011200,12 9 2012,Best

A2RIQKV4OOXME1,B0002CZUUG,jimrenfroe,I got this pretty fast. I took it out of the box and wanted nothing more than to give it 5 stars just for value alone. Im still shaking my head in disbelief that I got this guitar for the price. First the tuner issues that Ive been reading about. Replace the strings! I stretched and stretched these things and they would not stay in tune. A set of DAddario 10s cured that straight away (or whatever you prefer just change them). The tuners arent the best but they are not to blame its the cheap strings. Now technically if you only play open chords this was playable out of the box. The neck angle was so off the A string rattled no matter how high I set the bridge. The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle. Yes I could have sent it back but I suspect I would have gotten another just like it. I had to spend about 6 hours shimming the neck AND the nut (Never had to do this to the nut on an electric not even on a used guitar. The nut slot was cut too deep) as well as working on leveling nearly every fret to make it playable. It required 3 business cards to shim the neck which is the most Ive ever had to use. After I got that straight I removed a bit of paint from the neck and set it with wood glue in the pocket and on all the screws. In my opinion this helps a great deal with these and all bolt ons for that matter.If I bought this used none of this would have been a big deal. But as Im looking at this horrid neck angle and doing all this work Im steadily staring at the QC passed sticker. Must have been built on a Friday afternoon or something.--- NOW--after I did this it is sweet!!. I play through a Peavey Valveking 100 and it rocks as good as my Strat w/  Duncans and Dimarzios. The quality of the electronics is not sub par at all. After adjusting the pickups screws to match the string height and getting all the horrible wax off them  Id argue that this is as good as any Epi Ive ever played as far as pups and all so dont hesitate there because I dont really care for Epis and Im in love with it. (I bought this to sell mainly but now????)  The build quality; hmm if you can do guitar work go for it. Otherwise Id highly recommend a more expensive model. The $299 models are great right out of the box usually.,3 Stars Good value but it needed a lot of work,1395532800,03 23 2014,Average
A3MRBUCGH66JTY,B0002CZUUG,K. Andrews Permanent tourist,If you are considering this guitar I have to assume youre shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end not trying to decide between this and a Gibson Les Paul Custom.  It is in the category of beginner/intermediate guitars that I rate this a 5 star instrument.I really couldnt find anything wrong  with it.  Yes it has shortcomings as compared to the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls such as having only two controls for volume and tone rather than four which also means it has a slightly different look that the famous Gibson.  But you werent planning to try to fool anyone were you?  Beginning players would be well advised to focus on developing their skills and honing technique rather than fussing around with tone controls anyway.The sound is good and I found the appearance and finish of mine to be just fine.  The pickups are surprisingly good.  The same electronics are found on some of the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls.  It was no great surprise to find that the strings are no good although it would sure be nice if they didnt cut corners on such an inexpensive component that is also integral to sound quality.As for fit and finish reading the reviews has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a Monday after a long weekend of partying.  For several reasons if I had this to do over I would not buy it online (nor would I buy it from GC).  Better to inspect the actual guitar youll be buying and dont be shy about asking them bring out another one if you dont like the first one you see.I discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price but they would have included a full professional setup including string change.  You are likely to find a similar deal where you live because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the Internet and GC.As it is I took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup.  It had some intonation problem the action was too high and as others have commented the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately.  I asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners as Id read a lot of people trashing the tuners.  Bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them he instead assured me that they were fairly decent and advised against changing them unless a problem develops.Out of the box I was a little unsure of my purchase.  However now that its been fully set up  and new strings installed I am quite pleased with this guitar.  I dont believe you will find a better guitar or even close at this price level.I did a lot of shopping and considered guitars up to $500 for my first foray into electric.  I was tempted to go with something more expensive on the theory that in a couple years Ill want to upgrade anyway.  Now Im glad I chose this one.  For one thing this is a guitar Ill always enjoy having around.  There is nothing cheap or toy-like about it.  In 2-3 years my tastes may change.  I may want something completely different down the road and now I still have that option.  Had I gone with a more expensive model Id feel locked in.  No good!BOTTOM LINE:  If youre shopping for a guitar in this price range I think youll be pleased with this guitar.  Buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar youre buying and negotiate to have a setup included because it will almost certainly need one.  Have it set up right install some quality strings and youll be very happy with the Epiphone LP Special II.,Nice guitar and a great value,1334793600,04 19 2012,Best
A2EDYSY4M8TESS,B0002CZUUG,kbgulfcoast,I got one of these a while back and being like I am with guitars took it apart to see just what its made of.Mahogany ply maybe or capped with real but its plywood body inside.Kinda shocked in competitive guitar market that epi would go there...Otherwise decent build basic original lp design bolt on surprisingly good electronics w/ full size pots and open back 3 way toggle good neck but bad tuners.... Note: any 45% mount tuners meaning mount hole at 8 and 4 oclock position respectively... Will fit with the bottom hole of the 2 screw junk tuners mine had.  So add 10$ to get more than 30 minute in tune play here.And you can fill the other little holes with nail polish like it was made right to begin with.I like the style and though theres plywood involved still good fit and finish though many disagree it makes no real difference what electric guitar body woods are only in looks.  Electric guitars dont resonate thats why pickups are important.I dont like the idea of this as beginners choice for the simple fact of cheap tuning keys.You lose interest learning on something that cant hold good tuning.  So that bugs me that big player choice like epi would do that.Its likely theyll keep this style but revise it some... to be hardwood body and real tuners as I  think the price point demands it.  Otherwise a decent piece good wiring decent pickups... But...,Not mahogany....,1379030400,09 13 2013,Average
A1GUHIMGFE362L,B0002CZUUG,Kev,Pretty sweet guitar for the price. Sounds like and plays like a Les Paul. I really like the vintage sunburst color (Its more orange than what the picture shows). The strings were setup on the nut close to the fret board the way I like it already when I got it. I just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference.

A2ZGEV4CTSCTIZ,B0002CZUUG,Kodack,My axesEpiphone LP Studio deluxe plustopFender MarauderTakamine G320Squier Standard StratSquier Standard PJ bassBeen playing 20 years.I had a Squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar I didnt care about that I could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with. But it got old and I wore the frets out so I needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith. I picked up the LP special 2 in black at Guitar Center for $130 and they kicked in free strings.Bought it for a game but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good played so well and had a killer tone.My LP Studio had its pickups replaced with the Zakk Wylde 81/85s which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have. Imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone and playability. Considering this thing is almost the same prices a Bullet Squier it is easily twice the guitar for that price. You literally cannot find a better guitar for $150 than the Special 2.....Sound: 5/5Two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs deep lows and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.The pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.The pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic. Not sure which they have.So much sustain for a bolt on neck. I was shocked.Build Quality 4/5I did have 1 problem with the high E tuner. I didnt notice in the store but the string peg was 1/4 up out of the headstock. When I discovered this I loosened the string whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way.Intonation required no adjustment.Action was exactly the way I like itNeck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow.The finish was perfect. No nicks blemishes just oily black goodness.Neck was flush with no gaps or seams and professionally shimmed. Damn good for a bolt on.Hardware is typical for the price but does the job stays in tune very well.Back bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable.The bridge is similar to my LP Studio with the tunamatic setup. Individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts IE can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings.Weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but I soon got used to it. No pickguard and it doesnt need one. Lots of relief between strings and body. You wont find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick. Makes it easy to clean too!Truss rod is behind a nice body color plate.Frets were smooth rounded and played nice. Could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough.Neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to. I would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top soon got used to it and it wasnt an issue.500k pots and side body 1/4 TRplug keeps the cable out of the way.Overall 5/5Came with hex keys for setupCame with an awsome poster with all the Epiphone guitar modelsCame with a nice bumper stickerNo manualBody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks about the same as any other $150 guitar.Summary: This guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument I own. It sounds good enough to gig with out of the box. ITs well built plays well and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music. The frets are medium jumbos and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical Affinity or Bullet (2 squiers in this price range).I would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music. I did blues metal country and pop. The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.One thing I like about Epiphones and Gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge. This makes it VERY easy to palm mute and play with high gain. I lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my Strats the damn volume knob is in the way.As an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it. What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE. The tone was a little brighter and output a little lower still no hum but you wouldnt fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil. I ended up putting the screws back in.I will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in (hell yeah coil tapping here I come!) and move my EMG 81/85s in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.Do yourself a favor buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar. Its cheap enough that you wont care if you bang it around a little and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years.,Almost as good as my LP Studio deluxe plustop!,1389398400,01 11 2014,Best
A3CMXRFIWQCBKQ,B0002CZUUG,kodiakcowboy,This guitar is very attractive looking and plays well right out of the box.  I am a beginner guitarist so please take this review for what its worth.  I am extremely pleased and dont plan on ever upgrading.  This guitar is a darker cherry red wood color in the center than shown in the picture.  So expect it to be a different color than what you order.  See customer pics.It comes with strings installed and almost tuned.  The volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use.  The tremble and rhythm switch is far enough out of the way that youre not going to accidently hit it while strumming.  My only gripe is that the high E string gets caught on the top pickup when Im playing hard but maybe Im just a novice.  I will say that its very easy to play.Everything on it is very adjustable which I also like.  The only BUYER BEWARE statement I can think of is: youre going to be addicted to it!,Theres a reason it receives 5 star,1383177600,10 31 2013,Best
A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B0002CZUUG,Mike Tarrani Jazz Drummer,I purchased this when it was on sale during the Christmas season - I figured that for the asking price at the time I could not go wrong.My expectations were frankly low. I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune. Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability. What I received was the polar opposite: I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish and one that stays in tune (amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed it.)I am not wild about the strings that came stock but I am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums. I guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads. In the near future I intend to restring the guitar withDAddario ECG25 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Strings Light 12-52 which while thick should make the instrument jazz-friendly. I realize that flatwound strings will require a new set-up and intonation but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me the new strings and work will be an investment.Out of the box though the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared [to my novice eyes and fingers] to be properly dressed. I have already invested in a good - but not great case:Guardian Hardshell Electric Guitar Caseto store the guitar (I also uploaded a customer-provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits.)For the record I use the following amp which I have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar:Kustom Defender 15 Watt Class A Guitar Headthat I run through aKustom  The Defender 1 x 12 Guitar Extension Cabinet for 5H Head.Bottom line: this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players. The price is right and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year.,Five stars for value and playability,1334620800,04 17 2012,Best

A25ZBYVW8ZINLM,B0002CZUUG,Randy V. Brown,Im updating a previous negative review. I had some issues with this guitar when it arrived. I couldnt get it setup the action was very high and I couldnt set the intonation. Notes at the 12th fret were very sharp and I couldnt lower them with saddle adjustments. I missed one vital checkpoint the bridge needed to be lowered. Setup is finished and I can now agree with most reviewers. For the price this guitar is far better than any others in the price range. I know my grandson will enjoy it at least for awhile. If it ends up as a dust collector Im not out much on the purchase price.

A3KBFCPNQ58YK4,B0002CZUUG,Sam,The Epiphone Les Paul guitars dont particularly sound that great but they stay in tune much better than the cheap squier strat you can get at the same or lower price. If your kid is serious about wanting to play guitar but youre not completely sure if they will stick with it if you can spend another $100 and get a used mexican made fender strat or tele. The reason for this is because for 1 if they decide its not something they want to do anymore you can resell it at the same price you bought it for (as long as it is still in decent condition) and little no money is lost. Second if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a &#34;better&#34; or more high end guitar Mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use. I have a couple different high end guitars and I will not get rid of my Mexy Strat because it sounds great still.

A1UMOYYM8HB2A1,B0002CZUUG,Sirius,I purchased this guitar after much thoughtful consideration of other possibilities but the nearly universal high marks for this particular make and model finally persuaded me to go with this one and I do not regret that decision.First of all it is a beauty. Initially I was a little disappointed in that very little wood grain shows through the orangish finish. (My guitar was made in China which may account for the darker hue.) I thought I had wanted a lighter color but the more I look at it the happier I am with what I have. Second this instrument is no light-weight either in heft or playability. It is solidly constructed very well put together and plays like a dream. (I lowered the action until I encountered some fret buzz then backed off the adjusting screws just a bit; thats basically the only adjustment Ive made or likely will make.)Its been barely a day since the guitar arrived and as yet Ive only played it unplugged. I cant wait to hear how it sounds amped up.,Beautiful and perfectly made!,1378944000,09 12 2013,Best
A23AKO4BZLZ8DE,B0002CZUUG,stefanj,I have been playing for about 7 years now and have a Tak Jasmine Acoustic and a Jay Turser Strat knockoff.  I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price.  Ive read just about everything I can on these Epis and finally went to my local Music store to try one out.  My initial impression was somewhat mixed.  The sound was good but the action seemed off  After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar.  Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for.  Classic Gibson Les Paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat).  After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish.  They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING!  I sat down plugged it in and played a bit. Instantly I was in love.  The action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what Im used to).  The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated.  Tuning is a breeze and is held as well as any other guitar I own (I always retune before every session anyway).  Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar.  Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck the cheaper humbuckers the flat top construction and the basswood body.  I point to the angled headstock mahagony neck rosewood fret board and Gibson electronics.  I love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body).  Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol  If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer. Oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at $20 less than any place else AND they will do a FREE setup for me after Ive played it for a while (so far its been perfect out of the box).,Amazing sound...nice price,1317427200,10 1 2011,Best

A3BTH66WVCQAM9,B0002CZV46,chris,A friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and I loved having an on/off switch right at my fingertips. Genius!I bought 2 immediately. The shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp. Works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears.Two issues to consider. The right angle plug was a mm or 2 short of being able to stick into my Tele and my Takamine. It would not seat properly and would slide out. I had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side where it worked but now the switch is &#34;down there&#34;. I dont think Planet Waves is the first connector that I had a problem with that so I dont blame them but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure. Second issue is simply that these little button-switches are fussy. You have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them - feel wont do.

A2Y8JW5NSY95OL,B0002CZV46,JdoubleH,Update: The right angle switched end started developing crackling issues and is now intermittently cutting out. Ive had it just over a month so Amazon wont help me. Despite the lifetime warranty Amazon has only offered to let me pay shipping and to give me a partial refund. Despite being an authorized retailer for Planet Waves AMAZON DOES NOT OFFER EXCHANGE UNDER THE PLANET WAVES WARRANTY beyond the standard Amazon 30 day return policy. Amazon support referred me to the manufacturer. Ive emailed Planet Waves but the instructions for the warranty are to return it to a dealer for exchange. I dont have a dealer within 100 miles of my home so unless the manufacturer comes through this one is quickly becoming unusable and it looks like it might cost me to resolve it.I frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly. Ive used cables with the G&H; quiet plug (which also works well) but the switched connector on this has an advantage over the G&H-; you can use it as a mute and tune with a head stock tuner without unplugging your instrument. The cable itself is a bit stiffer than Im used to which makes coiling for storage very easy but it can quickly become a twisted mess on stage if you more length than you really need. The little elastic cord keeper strap works better than I could ever have imagined. Ive never given the sound of a cable a thought being a bass player who doesnt use much for effects and who plays mostly passive instruments. But using this with my Genz Benz Shuttlemax 9.2 and fEARful 15/6/1 cab I really notice a pronounced difference in clarity and dynamics. The sound is much more alive with this over any of the other cables I have from a variety of manufacturers (Hosa Proco Whirlwind etc). Ive never had to warranty exchange a PW cable but others tout the easy swap at any PW dealer as a great reason to buy them. I like knowing that. ** EDIT: AS STATED ABOVE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE IT THROUGH AMAZON BEYOND 30 DAYS **,Great design - love the switch,1368230400,05 11 2013,Average

IMHO it is not.The plugs are great but do not seem to have good cable grip. I like their old cables that had a long cable protector extending from the plug allowing the cable to flow gracefully from the guitar (and into the amp at the other end). The actual cable is horrible.... it is a hard plastic outer shell and does not lie or flex well like a good cable should (e.g. like my old Planet Waves cables do).

A1EX4410F46C8O,B0002CZV78,Matt32 LIGHT WEIGHT,First let me start by saying this pedal has been part of my setup for nearly 7 years now and still looks/sounds as great as the day it came out of the box.Its a Boss product which means you are going to pay for what you get.  You get the best bang for your buck with Boss products.  Solid rugged construction that is built to last (no chance of breaking one of these things) and an outstanding analog stomp box with a genuine sound.  Good customer support as well and if you ever feel you need to sale your Boss pedal resale prices are always good.While this pedal is capable of hundreds of tones and sounds (chorus is one of the most useful and versatile effects in my opinion)  Here are some of the best uses I have found.1. Tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect.  Perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full.2. Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects.  This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much.  There are a lot of bands tones I can come close to exactly matching tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve.3.  Liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads.  This pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out.  If you play any kind of Christian music you will soon learn it doesnt matter what you do as long as you put chorus on it.  Walking in on Sunday morning and turn out some Slayer while using a chorus pedal and they will go nuts.  Chorus is just one of those effects no matter what type of music you are playing you will always find a use for it so there is no excuse for not adding this pedal to your rig.In addition you have some great features easy access battery compartment accepts a 9v power supply works well with both guitar and bass 2 out puts so you can run to 2 sources if desired and all the controls you need to really be in complete control.

I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit. I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.Great tones! Easy operation!

AW97HQETLQ25Y,B0002CZV7I,Denis,I like the product a lot. For me the only problem is the time of the sustainer effect.It is not so long as I thought. I though it would be like the pianos sustainer.

A1365RYO0BLEMI,B0002CZV7I,John Barry,As several of the previous posters astutely mentioned you will need a noise gate to use this pedal. I completely agree with that. And it will sustain your notes. It will actually raise the volume to make them sustain. But you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up. The only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate. I use the NS-2 when I use my chain of pedals. That said this pedals has some wonderful uses. Every note will have the same volume. You can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume. You can set it to sustain for days. Again you will need a noise gate. There is nothing transparent about THIS compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors but none of them are as ACTIVE as this one. Perhaps thats the price you pay for what this pedal can do. I recommend messing with it quite a while. You can do some incredible funk jazz metal vibes out of it.,Great Pedal but YOU WILL need a noise gate.,1336780800,05 12 2012,Good

ADH0O8UVJOT10,B0002CZV7I,StormJH1,It really pains me to give anything but a 5-star review to a BOSS product since Im such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall.  Those compliments apply equally to the CS-3 Compression Sustainer.  And it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less-reliable brand in my signal chain.However there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know.  The two most common complaints that I see are that it adds noise to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit.  The former complaint is probably true though if youre enough of a hobbyist to use a Compression Sustainer youre probably already contemplated using a noise gate/suppressor such as the BOSS NS-2.  Problem solved.As for the latter complaint (changes tone) thats also true but its not necessarily a bad thing if you LIKE the tone that results.  The whole point of the CS-3 is that its supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it.  This can result in a muddy neutered tone though you can play with the TONE and other settings to help it.  I also find that with the settings all at 12 OClock the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings.Really while BOSS pedals are considered to be expensive compared to many of the other effects out there the CS-3 should really be viewed as a budget or entry level compressor when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a Keeley Compressor costing north of $200.  The best thing you can say about the BOSS (even compared to the similarly-priced MXR options) is that the CS-3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price.  The biggest negative of the pedal in my opinion is that the resulting sound might seem a little too...compressed.But there are a lot of things you could do with a CS-3 and it works best paired with other pedals (chorus delay some distortions) that youre trying to smooth out.  Ultimately its a pedal that could have been better though there arent too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of $100 anyway.,Good but not great sustain/leveler effect from BOSS,1346112000,08 28 2012,Good
A2XVE2J5WGCSGX,B0002CZV7I,William J. Stasse,As a pro musician I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner Digital Delay (2 of them) Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some!

A22Z554ZQ8NFPC,B0002CZV82,AF Whigs,Guitarists have become a bunch of cork-sniffers. There are so many players more concerned with the name on the headstock of their guitar and their amp and the endless boutique pedals in their collections that many seem unable or unwilling to give a listen to stock gear or anything that doesnt cost an arm and a leg.The fact is that if youre a gigging musician and I am you come to realize that all those subtle detailed nuances of tone that so many want to obsess over get lost in the band mix and in the poor acoustics of wherever youre playing.  Yes we want to sound good to ourselves because thats inspiring but frankly I dont need $200+ dollar distortion/OD pedals to be inspired.I havent owned a DS-1 in a long time but recently got one because I was looking for a distortion pedal on a budget.  Frankly Id forgotten how musical this pedal is.  With the distortion set to minimum (it never gets clean) its a good moderate-gain overdrive that still lets your guitars basic tone get through.  I play a strat & and jazzmaster - those guitars still sound like themselves with this thing.  With the gain at halfway you get great AD/DC crunch.  And even with the gain maxed out you still get excellent note definition on chords.  What more could you want?  Sure its old school rock distortion. The usual may not appeal to metalheads caveat applies maybe. Combine this with an eq and you could scoop the mids as much as you want.I also have a Barber LTD (great relatively cheap boutique moderate gain OD that doesnt break the bank) and a Visual Sound Route 66 which is a tubescreamer clone (with much more gain) and a compressor in one pedal.  Both the LTD & Rt 66 have the usual TS9 midrange hump though much less pronounced on the LTD.  Whats refreshing about the DS-1 is that the strong mids are there but the overall tone is not in the same realm as a tubescreamer so it can sit well on a pedalboard and bring a different flavor to the party.  The tone on the DS-1 can get very bright but as I indicated I play with single coils and I have no problem finding sweet spots on the tone knob - I generally run it around 9-10:00.Overall this pedal is a steal - look around and find a used one for a good price. Id considered a modtone Speedbox but decided to go with the generally bulletproof Boss instead for basically the same price.  I couldnt be happier.,Does what its supposed to do very well,1298592000,02 25 2011,Best
A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN,B0002CZV82,Charlo,Think of this as an artists tool.  And for every job there is the right tool.  Is this the best distortion pedal?  That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it.  If you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles.  It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 81/85s.  But arguing over what pedal is best is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise.  This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense. It it doesnt make sense there are ample Youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger.  It has been used by professional players like Steve Vai Joe Satriani and Kurt Cobain. It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians.  Its built like a brick and durable as all get-out.  I found mine used for $20 but the new asking price is fair. I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use but admittedly I dont detect any tonesuck with it.  Ive run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking.  It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads.  With the exception of modeler type pedals from companies like Tech 21 I do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp.  So if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your Marshall MG the problem is in your amp.,Solid pedal for a moderate amount of  tight sounding distortion,1360540800,02 11 2013,Good
A3J2PKECNUGEHO,B0002CZV82,D. Blackburn,I have had this pedal for about 15 years just replaced the old one a month ago. It distorts sound not quite the way you would imagine though. This effect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color. I use it through a Epiphone Valve Jr and a Marshall 2x12 stack with JTM45 on top and its fine. This thing through a Champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a EQ pedal.This does just what it says it does.

A21Q29J3ZWPDNP,B0002CZV82,From Detroit,This was the first pedal I ever bought when I started playing guitar 15 years ago.  Its still in my primary set up!  The sound it puts out is very balanced:  you can get a subtle overdrive-like sound out of it or a high-gain hard rock/80s metal sound out of it.

A2IDOKLAT1MP8X,B0002CZV82,Jared Burdick JBurd,This is a distortion pedal. It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl. Its pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion. The DS-1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp. You can dial the tone in but its a pretty harsh sounding.That said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to. My amp gives me a nice warm crunch classic rock style. The DS-1 gives me the 80s metal and punk rock sound I wanted and it does so flawlessly.It took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1. Its BOSS so it will last forever.Th only drawback is that its an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere. Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing but word to the wise dont pay more than $40 new for this thing.,The go to distortion pedal,1313798400,08 20 2011,Good

The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals.

A27L5L6I7OSV5B,B0002CZV82,Otto Correct,From Greg Abrams review entitled For all but the tone snobs a review further down on this products page:Alright so you want to get a good (if somewhat basic) distortion sound for less than $100? This is your deal.I strongly disagree.  You can find MUCH BETTER distortions for $100 or less even a few near or under the $40 mark the DS-1 is currently priced at.Ive played guitar for over 10 years.  Like many people one of my first pedal purchases was the DS-1.  Afterall everyone talks about them theyre available at any given music store in the nation you hear about all these famous musicians using them plus a DS-1 is actually pretty cheap!  So I snapped one up just like everyone else.  Come to find out that just because something is POPULAR that doesnt always mean its GOOD (see: Nickelback the Transformers movie franchise the Kardashian family etc...).So I plugged it in and didnt really care for it.  The distortion was harsh thin artificial sounding and always noisy.  I tried it on both my amps (My practic amp: a solid state Fender Frontman 25R and my big amp the B-52 AT100 which is a 100w tube halfstack) It was was not very diverse and the basic sound was not very likeable to me.  Ive read the Japanese made DS-1s are better in sound than the newer made in Taiwan models but either way the DS-1 is just not a great pedal in my mind.But like many newer players I didnt know any better at the time.  Fast forward a few years and Ive bought and sold literally dozens of pedals.  There is a whole world of great tones to be found out there if you keep your eyes open.So here are some pedals I currently own that I like much better than the DS-1.  All of them are great general purpose distortions easy enough to find new and used in most guitar shops and can at the time of this writing be bought brand new for $75 or less here on good ol Amazon.com and are rugged enough to last for years:Boss DS-2 Turbo Distortion:  Lest I catch any flames from people thinking Im a Boss hater (Im certainly not I loved the TU-3 the ODB-3 the MD-2 and the XT-2 among others) Ill start with the DS-1s big brother.  This pedal has a much nicer tone to it not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.  The I setting is pretty much a higher quality DS-1 the II setting is a brighter richer tone.  As the DS-1 completely overshadows the DS-2 in popularity you can find DS-2s all over ebay for very cheap prices.  A very worthy pedal unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2:  Great dirty distortion pedal.  Probably my personal favorite.  Youve heard this box used on literally hundreds if not thousands of songs in the last 30 years its used by just a ridiculous amount of guitarists.  Its a rich full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.  Ive never heard a bad tone out of mine. Its great for getting a big amp kind of sound out of a small practice amp.  Its also great for pushing a big amp with too much headroom into the overdriven sweet spot without having to crank the amp volume.  A truly excellent pedal.EHX Little Big Muff:  The Big Muff is another pedal youve heard on hundreds of songs.  Its kind of a fuzz kind of a distortion but definitely owns its own sonic territory.  Very big saturated and warm.  Used heavily in the 70s for classic rock tones also in the 90s and beyond for tons of grunge and garage.  Used by everyone from Carlos Santana and David Gilmour to the Smashing Pumpkins Dinosaur Jr. and Jack White.  I personally reccomend the Little Big Muff not only is it a touch creamier in tone than the recent NYC reissue its smaller uses a regular 9v adapter and its CHEAPER!  A great pedal.MXR Distortion +:  The Distortion + is a great first distortion and can usually be found pretty cheap.  Whats nice about the Distortion + is that it sounds great on anything and the lack of a tone knob helps keep it somewhat transparent i.e. you can more easily hear the natural tone of your guitar and amp it doesnt cover over your equipments sound.  Used by quite a few famous folks including the Greatful Deads Jerry Garcia Randy Rhoads (Ozzys famous guitarist) and Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols.Danelectro CM-1 Cool Cat Metal:  Make sure you get the Cool Cat Metal NOT the Metal II.  Thats a fine pedal as well but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.  The Cool Cat Metal or CM-1 is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals.  Basically its a pre-amp that sits on the floor.  It has a fully adjustable EQ with tons of volume and gain through the roof.  So you can do anything from a clean boost (with the gain at minimum there is virtually NO coloration to your tone) to high gain metal stuff with plenty of great overdrive and rock tones in between.  It works well with any amp Ive tried it on and you can find tons of great sounds.  Its an unbelievably versatile pedal and its even true bypass.  The best part is Danelectro seems to have made way too many of them so you can easily find one used or even new for under $30.  A true hidden gem thats actually CHEAPER than a DS-1.Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion:  This little guy surprised me.  Its supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box and if so that must be one awesome pedal too.  Its essentially a Marshall stack in a box and boy does it ever succeed at that.  Great crunch tons of volume and gain it really can make your practice amp sound like a big ragin stack!  It even sounded good going into my modeling amp (very few pedals work well with my modeling amp and this one even sounded better than the Marshall simualtion built in) and you can get a brand new one for $40 shipped fantastic!Speaking of Joyo Ive had a few of their pedals as well as one or two from MOEN another Chinese pedal maker and Im honestly floored by how nice they sound given their shockingly low price tag (especially theMOEN MO-FM Fuzz Moowhich honestly out Big Muffs every Big Muff Ive ever played through).  So JOYO and MOEN they both make a variety of great sounding fuzz od and dirt pedals check them out (and before anyone gets all up in arms about supporting a Chinese company please keep in mind that NONE of the pedals listed in my review DS-1 included are made in America let alone the western hemisphere).Hopefully these suggestions give you something to look for.  Also if you cant actually try a pedal out at the store YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs than more power to you.  Tone is subjective every pedal sounds different running through different guitars and amps and just because I may share different opinions on something that you love thats okay.  My main reason for posting this lengthy review is to give newer players some information.  You have PLENTY of options for distortion pedals the DS-1 is NOT the only thing out there thats affordable.  Find something you truly love and buy that.  If its the DS-1 one of the pedals Ive mentioned here or anything else the important part is that it sounds right to YOU.,Wish I knew then what I know now...,1309392000,06 30 2011,Bad
A3KBFCPNQ58YK4,B0002CZV82,Sam,Heres the deal with this pedal. It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. In my opinion for spending less than $100 for a distortion pedal whether it is your first pedal or 700th pedal a few more bucks will get you the MXR Badass distortion which has a much crisper tone to it.,Beginners Beware,1392940800,02 21 2014,Worst

A1N4PW6FTMBUSQ,B0002CZV82,Slashaholic Anonymous,This pedal has been around for a long time and though the overall quality has declined as Boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals the boss ds-1 remains the staple image of distortion stompboxs. The ds-1 is a no-frills tank of a pedal; it was designed to withstand a direct nuclear blast as well as Michael Moore stepping on it so you know it can take any amount of punishment you might care to give it.This pedal doesnt replicate any type of amplifier-its not a Marshall-in-a-box or a mesa boogie or a vox or a Fender; from a tonal aspect it isnt complex or dynamic. It will add plenty of grind to your tone and plenty of hum to go with it. If youre looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your 15-watt practice amp look no further. If you have a decent tube amp look elsewhere because with this pedal you get what you pay for and it simply will not do a quality amp justice.Pros: Inexpensive good build quality distorts your signal.Cons: Lots of hum the tone control gets really shrill really fast.Without the excessive hum and almost-unusable tone control this would get 4 stars.,The most basic of basic distortion pedals,1294444800,01 8 2011,Average

ADH0O8UVJOT10,B0002CZV82,StormJH1,Theres some element of nostalgia with the DS-1 that Ive just never understood.  I know theyre cheap.  I know theyre incredibly durable (as are all BOSS pedals).  I know everybody had one or tried one at some point and Kurt Cobain (apparently) used them with his Fenders.But I also know that Ive almost never been happy with the tone I get when I step on the pedal.  Its incredibly thin and harsh and lacks proper sustain even cranked all the way.  Ive used it on Marshall solid state amps and Vox tube amps.  Fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers.  You can mess with the TONE and DIST dials all you want but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals and even on-amp distortion with a richer deeper tone.Coincidentally I also used the BOSS OS2 Overdrive/Distortion for many years which is supposedly merges/blends a DS-1 with an OD-1.  That pedal isnt ideal either but if I turn the knob all the way to distortion its a much better tone than I ever got out of a DS-1.Then again it is very dependable and usually only $40 (or less) so I cant really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyones collection.  That just doesnt mean youll want to use it all the time.,Nostalgia Durability and Affordability...but not elite tone,1343174400,07 25 2012,Good
A3OEBPVLF35YQL,B0002CZV82,StratDude,... its a very generic-sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp.  The same is true of many of the pedals from this era including the (gasp!) Tube Screamer.  The Tube Screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp but not too many people will tell you that its a great stand-alone distortion because its not.  Same goes for the Boss DS-1.  Now heres where things get interesting:  There are PLENTY of modifications that can be done to this pedal by Keely Monte Allums and others that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks.  For the cost of this pedal and the $30 or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod are well worth it.  Mine is modified with the Monte Allums Tri-Gain Rectifier modification and its absolutely killer.  I use it as a lead boost but by itself its a nice overdriven tone that youll find plenty of use for.  If you want a basic solid well-built distortion pedal this is it - but by itself the Boss DS-1 is really nothing special.  But as a platform for great-sounding mods you cant go wrong.,Its been around for decades but.....,1350777600,10 21 2012,Average
A2F92AOWTIUIB,B0002CZV82,StudioDude,I know I know many people hate on this pedal calling it &#34;stale&#34; and &#34;generic&#34;. The problem that they have is that they simply havent found the right settings on the pedal and the amp because after all the settings on both the amp and the pedal do make a difference. One thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion. I have a Digitech Bad Monkey and I set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp. With this pedal I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone.,Truly one of the best.,1394755200,03 14 2014,Best
AZ0LJNEP2VRD1,B0002CZV82,Victor,This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. Its very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount if necessary) and more tone control but its also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I dont know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range.,Great for old-time distortion,1292716800,12 19 2010,Best
AUUI1FKERRMV2,B0002CZV82,Walter NYC,First off I am no expert on these things but I can tell you in the brief period in which I have owned my DS-1 I have enjoyed playing/practicing a lot more with this pedal.  I have a Fender wannabe guitar and a Fender Sidekick 10 which means my gear isnt the best but the pedal produces a wide variety of distortion and tone changes which keeps me interested.  I am having so much fun that I dont even notice my fingers hurt anymore.  Honestly this is an essential buy when starting out along with headphones and a cord extension so the police dont come a knockin.(update Sept 2012)It is a year later and I have a much better guitar and amp and a lot more knowledge.  I am glad I got the DS-1 but for other reasons.  Sure it made me enjoy playing and practicing a lot more but I soon found the sound was off considering I like more blue and classic rock.  Again for the money I dont think you can beat it but more importantly when you have a few buck you can send it out for modification from Keeley.  Initially I had wished I went with and overdrive (OCD or Boss OD-3) but with the mod done by Keeley I have a super flexible pedal that cover just about all the sounds I need.  In closing spend the $40 buck and get this....and then when you start wishing it could do more send it off to be modified and you will thank yourself later.,Great 1st Pedal (updated),1324339200,12 20 2011,Best
AJK15Q9JOEHRH,B0002CZVA0,aceofbase,Good metal distortion tone with bags of sustain but sucks a lot of tone (most metal pedals do) and is moderately noisy. If you are looking for classic rock sounds you wont find them here. Can get muddy at times but there are plenty of settings to tweak to get the sound you are looking for. I find it useful for high gain leads and palm mute rhythms but note definition is not so good with chords.

A1CD7IUM2JRPY1,B0002CZVA0,Alexander V. Ramos Doc Taz,Ive had this for about 11 years now. Even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market this pedal still sells well. Not to mention its probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. Theyre usually on the side of improving the stock tone which Im happy with.Ive always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal. The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal/hard rock music the gain range is enough for me. If I need yet more gain I punch it up with an overdrive or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without a boost I can use it for death metal. I think if you play the tighter more technical styles its better not to have too much gain anyhow.,Still the best.,1265846400,02 11 2010,Good

So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON.

This pedal wont give you a cranked up tube stack sound.  No...  Instead its very edgy and smooth as can be.  It has a mid-sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone.  I usually use it as a mid-boost for solos.  Youll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you wont be able to replicate (easily... Im sure the huge Boss distortion box comes close but for the price...) with any other pedal.,Very useful pedal to have.,1270857600,04 10 2010,Best

I also have a very old little peavey practice amp this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life.Listen to it on the Boss website I heard to it and then I thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them but it does sound really really close. regards. forgive my english... not from the U.S,Great,1299024000,03 2 2011,Best

A1EX4410F46C8O,B0002CZVA0,Matt32 LIGHT WEIGHT,First of all I want to say I love a tube amp distortion.  Overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be.  I run a Randall G3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state Ive used or heard.  For recording I use a Peavey 5150 and its so sweet.  Tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard.Recently I started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that I felt like could only be achieved through a pedal.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals I used the DOD death metal for years when I first started playing.  However there is a downside.  Go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old AM radio if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250.  Quality dist. pedals are not budget friendly.I chose the MT-2 because I know Boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using.  It gives a variety of sounds.  It can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones.  The controls make it very tweakable and I have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it.  Read the included book look up some MP3s over videos online and check out other guitarists settings.  It will help you tame this pedal into what you want.  Perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot.  There are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful.Ive seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz.  I must say learn how to shape sound spend time dialing it in to your rig.  Within 10 minutes I was pleased with the MT-2.  I used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick heavy distortion with a good response.I say the MT-2 is worth an investment if youre looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal.  Surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board.,One of the better distortion pedals,1303084800,04 18 2011,Good
A1GMWTGXW682GB,B0002CZVA0,MetalFan,This is a great pedal I picked up used they can be had cheaply on the used market. I actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit. The 2 EQ pots on the front panel make it very versatile enough to use with a cigar box guitar also.The pedal can preserve bass signal and still be EQd for saturated distortion. The other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular. I also other Boss Distortion pedals. Like most people I own a DS-1 and an MD-2 which are both cheap and effective. I own a HM-2 Heavy Metal 2 which caters more to the traditional metal sound and I actually think this pedal is more versatile IMO with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone.I also own an older 80s HM-2 Heavy Metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that I could never part with overall i like this pedal but it cannot top the older legendary Boss pedals.,Versatile pedal for distortion but not the best.,1342569600,07 18 2012,Good

It really does have a ton of range although it only does one effect at a time so youd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations.  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 oclock which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect.

I had used Bosss metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced. I play through a 59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed.

A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN,B0002CZVBE,Charlo,For the money I have no complaints.  The enclosure dials and footswitch are all durable.  Not true bypass but none of the BOSS pedals are.  It doesnt suck tone.  This pedal isnt the end-all be-all overdrive but with asymmetrical clipping it fills a niche that TS pedals dont. You lose a little low end when it is engaged but that actually works pretty well for leads- especially with humbuckers or amps with a looser kind of classic distortion encountered with EL84s.  As a stand alone overdrive I prefer other pedals.  But where this pedal really works for me is as a boost to other dirtboxes or an already overdriven amp.  You get singing harmonic leads when it is dialed in right.  Like any overdrive you introduce noise when the pedal is engaged and things can get hissy while you are palm muting if you crank it too far.  I am a dirtbox hoarder and I like to rotate the pedals and try different combinations.  Lately I am running this into either the V1 Cool Cat transparent overdrive (Timmy Clone - very very nice) or the Behringer BO-100 (which is a dead ringer for the Boss Blues Driver) then into a tube amp that is dialed in on mild crunch (Jet City Combo or Palomino Combo).  As with any overdrive this thing will not sound very good (IMHO) running into a solid state amp.  Thats just not what it was intended to do. It was intended to drive preamp tubes into saturation but YMMV. Because Im a cheapskate (and because these things are durable like bricks) I bought it used for $20 but it is well worth the new asking price.,Nice pedal !,1348012800,09 19 2012,Good

A21Q29J3ZWPDNP,B0002CZVBE,From Detroit,I picked this up in order to boost my gain on my amp a bit.  It does a wonderful job of that (Drive set low and the level set high.  Tone set to taste.)  The additional noise it produces is relatively low so you wont have any excessive staticy buzzing sound to deal with.

A1GMWTGXW682GB,B0002CZVBE,MetalFan,I bought this pedal used and have used it with both a Fender tube amp and a Marshall solid state using clean channels. I can get a variety of tones from it with different guitars and reccomend it as a first overdrive or to add to a collection.While I have several overdrive pedals this one is good at giving some basic overdrive tones while keeping the amps low end. I can get decent tones from a Telecaster and Les Psul by keeping the level and tone knobs below 12 oclock and adjusting the drive to taste.The OD sounds great through Fender clean tubes and I also tried it with a bass guitar. With some adjustment of the tone and drive knob the bass has an overdriven tone with a good drive.The other reviews here prove this pedal is typical and iconic Boss in build quality. I find the Boss pedals good for their purpose and have mostly modded the ones Ive owned after some time but I may keep this one as is and use it as a boost. These pedals last forever and I only paid $20 for mine.,Good value and works well with solid state and valve amps,1344816000,08 13 2012,Good

ADH0O8UVJOT10,B0002CZVBE,StormJH1,I held out from trying the Boss SD-1 Super Overdrive for many years.  Like many guitarists my first distortion pedal was a Boss DS-1 which was durable and aggressive but also extremely frustrating.  I might have formed some negative impressions about Boss when it was probably unfair to do so.The SD-1 is widely owned and very affordable (usually around $50).  Its similar in a lot of ways to the Ibanez TS-9 Tubescreamer except that a Tubescreamer reissue costs twice as much.  A lot of guitarists consider the SD-1 to be more of a rock overdrive while the TS-9 is more of a tube/blues effect.  Theres probably some truth to that but both of them are excellent pedals.However the SD-1 really impressed me with its transparency and versatility.  You CAN simply plug into it and use it alone with a clean channel.  But that isnt necessarily the best use for the pedal - it excels as a booster pushing an already overdrive amp or stacking with other distortion/OD pedals.  One of the best settings is turning the Level all the way up and the gain all the way down.  This adds just a little bit of grit to your tone and really sounds great.A feel that lot of people give the SD-1 mediocre reviews for reasons that arent fair.  You hear things like it cuts out too much bass when thats really what the pedal is supposed to do.  The midrange hump when set up properly can take away the muddiness of your tone and help you cut through a band during live playing.  And like I said before I feel as if its MORE transparent in retaining elements of the clean tone than the TS-9 though preference between the two is entirely subjective.But you also know that its a Boss pedal which means its as durable as they come.  The thing will stand up to years of abuse and can be used in any number of roles.  If youre looking for a single pedal to make a small amp sound big there are probably better options in this range.  (Try the under-appreciated MD-2 Mega Distortion or the excellent Joyo Ultimate Drive).  But if you understand what this pedal is supposed to do and use it for that purpose youll understand why this thing has been popular for over 30 years.,A versatile overlooked classic overdrive from BOSS,1356912000,12 31 2012,Best
A3JEEPYPEM9V81,B0002CZVBE,Tim,Great as a booster as others have said. For solos itll boost your mids and your signal. As an overdrive its great kind of a midsy Marshally sound. It does suck out some of the low end but you can fix that on your amp or board or whatever. Its a Boss its solid - and a great price. Remember this is overdrive - not distortion. For distortion look at other Boss pedals.,For a boost and more,1336176000,05 5 2012,Best
AZ0LJNEP2VRD1,B0002CZVBE,Victor,I have several overdrive pedals some of which are much more expensive than the BOSS SD-1. For a long time I overlooked my SD-1 and used other pedals. But when I went back to trying the SD-1 I was pleasantly surprised to find that this relatively inexpensive pedal is superior to some of the pedals I had been using. I dont mean merely that its very good relative to its price; I mean that its very good--period. It easily outclasses some pedals for which I paid much more. The price for this pedal sometimes goes down to about $45 on Amazon. At that price its an amazingly good deal. Note: This is definitely an overdive pedal; it will not deliver metal distortion (at least not by itself). If you want to ride the crazy train look elsewhere (like Deltalabs Metal Distortion pedal). What this produces is smooth old-style overdrive. Its excellent. It sounds especially good through a dash of chorus. I plug my SD-1 into a Fender Mustang II amp and turn on the amps chorus; the result is delicious. Ive used the SD-1 with both single-coil and double-coil pickups. Both sound good though not surprisingly you get a heavier punch with a humbucker. But it sounds great with single-coils too.,A gem!,1305417600,05 15 2011,Best

They were more like a boost volume and tone pedal with tremolo thrown in.  I wanted something to dress up slow ballads and of course Born On The Bayou.  This pedal goes from nice subtle background effect to deep depth if you want it.  And no variance in your guitar tone or volume when you click it on.

It does not vary the pitch.You have control over the depth or amount of effect and you can control how fast the effect pulsates the sound.A very simple popular effect that I wouldnt want to live without in some form or another.Pretty teal green color.As with all Boss products they are built like a tank and generally last forever if they are not abused or damaged.I have no idea how fast this pedal eats batteries because I use a power supply.There is no on/off clicking when depressed.There is no added hiss hum or distortion.The battery compartment is easily accessed without having to unplug anything.Simply a great effect and quality product from Boss and tends to hold its resale value well.,Great Tremolo from Boss,1343520000,07 29 2012,Best

You can barely bring it in for some warmth or really crank the speed and depth for a great sort of rotary speaker effect.Ill use it with the rate set at tempo for a song and record clean guitar chords up on the middle of the neck.

(Note: It comes with a 9v battery installed but it does NOT come with a power source/adapter.) If the price is more than youre willing to pay consider the DANELECTRO COOL CAT TREMOLO. This also delivers good tremolo but it does not allow for as much sound-manipulation as the BOSS product; its still quite good but the BOSS takes the prize.

AH2F47XZ5L8NR,B0002CZVHI,Violet Deliriums,I own three units capable of tremolo: Boss TR-2 Line 6 MM4 and the Boss SL-20 Slicer (like a tremolo on steroids). Plus my amp is a Twin Reverb so it too has tremolo. If you are unfamiliar tremolo modulates the volume as if turning it up and down rapidly.The Boss TR-2 is the simplest of the three stompboxes to operate with three controls: Rate of modulation Depth of modulation (how much does the volume vary) and a Wave shape (jagged square or somewhere on a continuum in between). Unlike the other Boss stompboxes I own (CE-5 & PH-3) the TR-2 does not seem to compress sound so that it seems like youre playing in a fishbowl (as another reviewer puts it).The Wave control is what gives the unit its sonic versatility so it is a nice feature to have. Most tremolos have it but not all. For the price it can give you a decent set of classic tremolo sounds with nothing too crazy. It is the unit that Tom Morello uses on Guerilla Radio and it does well with tremolo classics like the Smiths How Soon Is Now? I hear no volume drop problem like other reviews suggest and this is something I am sensitive to because I generally turn modulations on/off over the course of a song rather than leave them on full time.Like all Boss stuff the box is sturdy and I like their big quiet footswitches over any of the little clicky ones on other units. The color is a sort of a dull military dark green not the most attractive thing but not bad either.The small Boss effects do not come with a power cable so you will have to factor that into the cost. Boss instructions tell you that you need their particular adapter but I dont know anyone who says this is a must. I run it off a pedalboard power supply and it seems to work fine. If it didnt I would not buy Boss product period.Bottom Line:(1) Gives a decent array of basic tremolo sounds nothing crazy(2) Not a bad price (factor in a power cable)(3) Simple to operate(4) Nice casing and footswitch; drab color,Nice Basic Tremolo Sounds,1360108800,02 6 2013,Best

A356RFKNIG043B,B0002CZVI2,K. Swanson,This is the best little guitar pedal adapter Ive used and Ive used many over the last three decades. Its exceptionally quiet which many are not and it puts out 9.6 volts which will drive your pedals a little more solidly than all but a brand new alkaline battery. And you wont have to buy a new one every dozen hours!Ive used this on a splitter to drive three pedals but at four and up I can hear the current drop a bit. Still thats a good thing because it reminds me that tone comes from my fingers not a box on the floor. But it sure is nice to have some Gilmouresque delay and a little extra gain driving the tubes and this is the best 9v adapter for pedals available that I know of including the Boss ones.

The reason I took off one star is because the wire is really thin and doesnt seem too durable so because of this I have been very careful so it doesnt get broken.

But I am not sure that I am giving up tone in exchange for the headache avoidance!  I kinda think I am.  The VOX and BBE seem to have a brighter sound which is less wah-ed if you will.

A73CB1NVPYDZ5,B0002CZVK0,Devin Sir Flexalot,The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isnt always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle and just leave it there.  You cant really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah but in my experience the sound is equivalent on the base models.,Step to turn on/off,1209686400,05 2 2008,Average

You have to pretty much push it toe foward and then literally stomp on it to turn it on and then follow the same steps to turn it off.  Very inconvenient for someone who is trying to rapidly move between effects on a board.  I cant say its just a complete piece of junk it does give you a wah effect it is a classic pedal but THERE IS BETTER out now so why are we still stuck in the stone age with this thing?  I even had someone mod mine and while it gave it a little more headroom and fixed the dropping issue I still had to slam on it to turn it on/off and it still sounded like a cheap wah.My suggestion?  The Mark Tremonti wah is great!  Kicks this things end when it comes to range and simplicity to use!  It may cost more but you will probably end up hating the crybaby and getting one anyway so just go with the Tremonti Power Wah to begin with.  What I use for wah is the Digitech RP250 processor.  You may say that this is a cheap processor and it is but Ive been using it for years and I havent seen anyone that can tell the price of it based on the sound quality and thats what matters.  Why I suggest it for wah is you can control the sensitivity how hard you have to press your toe down to turn it on (I have mine set fairly light) and you can totally shape your tone right there on the board very easily.  You even have presets (crybaby being one of them)  You can get an entire processor full of effects AND an awesome wah for a little bit more.If you want a cheap childs gimic-type toy this is for you.  Want to get serious about a wah?  Spit on every crybaby you see and go elsewhere.,serious musicians look elsewhere,1306713600,05 30 2011,Average
A8MQNZK3J0UEX,B0002CZVK0,Paul C.,Ive had my wah pedal for a number of years now. What I can say is that it has put up with a lot of use no problem with the pedal itself mechanically. However the cheap rubber feet were the first victims of perhaps taking a few cheaper short cuts on producing the product. That is to say the rubber feet began to come off in no time. If you mount it on a pedal board you will probably remove those feet and this wont be a problem. Also the power supply that comes with it does a stellar job of powering the pedal. If you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable at least on my unit the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts. Those shorts can make a crowd deaf in no time flat. What I have learned is that when using a different power supply to be sure the power jack is push ALL THE WAY in otherwaise ZAP. Other than those two issues the power issue really no fault of Dunlops if you use the supplied power cable its been a great pedal.

Id rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great.

I suspected that the potentiameter was shot so I had that replaced but the same problems reoccurred.

I can park it on the headstock of my ukulele and it is easy to add move remove. With the trigger-type release it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos Ive used. It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  I like how the trigger portion sticks upwards and does not get in the way like myDunlop Trigger Banjo Capo Black.  My favorite is still the G7th capo.  This is a close second to the G7th.My only nitpicky complaint is how it is not eligible for Amazon Prime.  UPDATE:  I just saw that this capo is eligible for Amazon Prime.

A3775OP5VTX5ON,B0002CZVWS,Coolkayaker ck1,Costs about 2x as much as some cheap capos and its worth every single penny.  THis has a strong clip yet does not damage my concert or tenor ukulele necks.  It won;t budge once you clip it and its low profile.  Made of metal it should last a lifetime.I took off one star only for one thing: the hand clip portion of this does sometimes get in the way of fretting because it sticks out from the neck quite a ways.  Some other capos like this oneJim Dunlop 7828 Russell Banjo/Uke Capodoes not have anything that you can hit your hand on when fretting.  Sometimes I try the Kyser on the opposite side away from me the player.  But it seems to still hit my hand on some chords just different ones.  That said I can work around it and its a lifelong capo of fantastic build and keeps those strings from buzzing at all on all my ukes.

A24JUT24W1K3CV,B0002CZVWS,Mr Tall,Although this capo is marked as correct for a mandolin it only works correctly above the 3rd or 4th fret on my mandolin. Any lower on the fretboard than that and this capo doesnt have enough pressure to work on the 1st or 2nd fret position on my mandolin even though my mandolin has a fairly low action.I have a number of Kyser capos and very much like the style (I own at least six Kyser guitar capos and use them on all of my guitars from a Taylor 12-String to a Fender American Strat without any problems) but in this case the banjo capo didnt work for what I need. Perhaps the capo sent to me was defective although I have enough decades of experience with stringed instruments to know that it didnt seem broken just not up to the task.From feedback others have sent to me it is possible this capo may work for you if you wish to take a chance on it but I know that I dont have time while on stage to take 20 seconds to set a fussy capo just right to make sure it is holding just right and then hope it doesnt start to buzz on me in the middle of a song.

You can never go wrong with a Kyser.  Not only that I like the idea that its an US company.  Ive had some cheaper capos and they just dont do the job.

I have two of the black ones on a 7 string Ibanez RG7321 and Laguna LE200QBC guitars. I have spare straps for both guitars and sometimes I lock those spares with the plastic Dunlop discs.I have some older bass guitars with similar Dunlop locks (the standard version) two of which had locks installed in the mid 1990s and one from 2003 with the gold DD. All three of them have held up with no issues. I didnt need to re-tighten the screws on those guitars until about two years ago.

A3S737ZGWE1GKY,B0002CZVXM,Anon,So I bought these because being Dunlop I trust the brand. I dont even mind that they are sorta big and bulky. The only problem I have is they scare the piss out of me. Its not a tighten washer and nut situation with what ive normally seen on strap locks. These have pegs that insert. Its so hard for me to trust these I always have 1 hand gripped firmly on guitar even if just adjusting the amp I clench my guitar. So scared that the little metal balls things will just slip peg fall out and ruin a $500 guitar. I havnet had a single problem with this system yet and I never hope that I do.

A1EUO0BU72JR7T,B0002CZVXM,Bilbo,I tried this model a few years ago and I never had a problem with them (once I got it installed) but I went back to the Schallers I had on my other instruments.  I thought (and this has been mentioned by others) that it makes the strap stick too far out from the instrument which I thought looked goofy.  I also didnt particularly care for the push button release and getting the locking part on the end of my thick strap was a challenge; these have a C clamp not a nut so theres no allowance for differing thickness. I also felt safer with the Schallers which hook onto the end of the guitar strap button and didnt depend on a spring loaded button to keep the parts together.  As I said I had no real problems with them so if they look like theyd work for you great.  As with all replacement strap locks/buttons you have to make sure the screws are secure in the button holes before you start jumping off of drum risers dropped out of airplane or what have you.,I Prefer Scahllers...,1289779200,11 15 2010,Good

A23033Q9WZBG4V,B0002CZVXM,Christian Farrar Chris Farrar,they work well. For me the instalition wasnt that hard it took me maybe four or five minutes. The screws provided were a bit bigger than my BC Rich Avenge Beasts stock strap system BUT when you read the directions and lube the screws up with a small amount of bar soap (or wax- i used the bar soap though) the installation becomes easier.Once you put your strap in its NOT comming out unless you try hard to undo the system lol.If you need to clean your guitar strap take off the locking pin and use a flat head screw drive to pop off the retainer clip.

Money well spent makingsure my stringed instrument does not accidentally fall to the ground. Besides safety I also like being ableto swap out my straps on my guitars. Its a nice convenience. If you are so inclined you can use the samestrap for all your guitars.If you are not sure if they will work on your brand guitar seek out an online forum and either search thatforum for the answer or join and ask your questions. Youve got a pricy piece of wood there and will wantto take care of it properly.What I dont care for but feel okay with because they work so well is how big they seem to be. Theydont get in the way when being used but look almost out of place. That is why I chose Black for mysecond set. Helps keep the products profile down a bit. Other than that the product works asadvertised....NOTE: As of June 2014 I have installed two other sets and all are still working as expected. Do rememberto check and make sure your hardware is secure. After repeated use the screws can come loose and therewill be trouble if this happens.

A19IFF0DGV0T3E,B0002CZVXM,HLB HLB,Whats great about the Dunlop design:They work!  The only thing you need to do is ensure youve got them engaged properly at the time you attach your strap onto your guitar i.e. just make sure you established a solid connection then go ahead and gig your rear-end off without worry.The design encorporates bearings that allow the strap to freely move around/rotate on the post which is exactly what you want.  The schaller ones (see below) have a major flaw in them from my familys experience.  We will never run anything other than this design going forward.What doesnt work with the Schaller Design:Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist have been using Shaller-style locks for a while now.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend. The problem with the design is theres a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab thats screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  Weve tried applying bar soap petro jelly and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe were all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.,Vastly Superior Design/Function compared to Schaller Style,1351123200,10 25 2012,Good
AMACM7BGUQCZD,B0002CZVXM,IBZANE,Straplocks have been around for a long time but now You can use the instrument with a regular strap as well This dual design sold me on it..Easy to install on the guitar. A little difficult getting the lock mechanism installed on the strap still only took about ten minutes to do.  The added security of knowing your 1200 dollar bass isnt going to hit the floor makes it very well worth the small cost of this item..,Dont know why I put off getting this,1346284800,08 30 2012,Good
A20L3BCRCICRSQ,B0002CZVXM,Jake,I have never owned a Straplock system prior to owning these Dunlops and boy am I amazed!  Every straplock system Ive used in the past on friends guitars semi-permanently mounted the strap to the guitar - often with extra ties and all manner of things that made it impractical to detach the strap on a whim.  In contrast these locks have a mechanism that make it trivially easy to pop the strap on and off - its great!  Better still the hardware fit almost perfectly into my existing screw holes making installation trivial.  And the new posts are so close in size and shape to the old ones that I think I could slap any strap onto my guitar in a pinch using the posts like the OEM ones.  This is a great system and I would highly recommend it for anyone who uses a strap on any electric guitar.,What a fantastic way to secure a guitar!,1392854400,02 20 2014,Best

A2X2GEABQXRX7P,B0002CZVXM,J. Carney Mongoose,These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasnt until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more Ill stick with Schallers. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.,Not as good as Schallers!,1379808000,09 22 2013,Worst
A2WROWUBLQ9GZZ,B0002CZVXM,J.C.,Ive been using the same Straploks on all my guitars for the past 10+ years.  I have not had one fail on me ever.  Just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure its on right.  Ive struggled with the C clip in the past but what are you going to do?  Its a one time thing when you first install so its no biggie.,Reliable,1395187200,03 19 2014,Best
A3FW4THIMBIN6V,B0002CZVXM,Jeffrey A. Hawkins HumanJHawkins,I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2) Engineering : The instructions recommend and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically if the screws werent total crap this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver wont fit and get the things properly installed it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set heres what I recommend:Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1 oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these wont fit properly but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesnt need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal and recommend that your friends try a different brand!,Disappointing Quality and Engineering,1306886400,06 1 2011,Bad
A3F1GM7ZAZD1SW,B0002CZVXM,jmhr,The very first thing I noticed about the design is how far from the guitars surface the strap is actually connected.  What this tells me is there is considerable added stress to the screw and the wood surrounding it because of the added leverage to the guitars weight.  The &#34;fulcrum&#34; is the surface of the wood if this makes sense and I cant help but wonder if it could eventually (eventually over much time and use) cause cracks or splits as a result.I found someone selling only the Dunlop strap buttons which is a great idea for someone with 2 main straps and several guitars and was about to order them when I found Planet Waves Elliptical End Pins.  I think this is the best idea yet for keeping a guitar on a strap unless youre going to be spinning the guitar around your shoulders and no additional stress on the guitars body.

AG8FGAIPRBKIR,B0002CZVXM,Jolly Roger,I agree with another reviewer that the included screws strip much too easy.  I purchased a set of these strap locks years ago and I dont recall having this issue so Im thinking that Dunlop changed the screws at some point.  I was luckily able to get the screws in with some muscle and the locks are secure.  However due to this issue Im considering other alternatives for another guitar of mine that could use strap locks.  I hope Dunlop fixes this issue soon.,Screws strip too easy but good if you can screw in,1331337600,03 10 2012,Average
A1YP96MT6W9FTB,B0002CZVXM,JPfromOH,The Dunlop Dual Design Straplock System is a sturdy fairly easy-to-assemble and easy-to-install alternative to guitar straps slipping off of instruments.  The screws that are used to attach the Straplok to the guitar are heavy gauge and pretty large--theres little chance that these are going to come out.  The locking mechanism seems like it is secure and should require little maintenance.  The only disadvantage of the Dunlop system to Schallers system is that the the Dunlop sticks out measurably farther from the guitars body.  Ordinarily it seems like this should be only the most minor of inconveniences.  On an instrument such as a Hofner violin bass though or any guitar with a strap button on the back of the instrument this makes it difficult to hold the body of the instrument against your body for support.  Schallers strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players.  The Dunlop Straplok System is sturdy should provide a long life of service and can be found at a better price than several of its competitors.

AH4HBHRM707WA,B0002CZVXM,L Scott LK,I know this is a great product.  Ive had a set before.  I have to knock off a star because a part was lost during shipping that renders the product useless.  The product comes in a clam shell package.  For me it shipped with some heavier stuff that impacted the package and let it open some.  There are two retaining clips that slipped out and since the main shipping box wasnt fully taped up one slipped completely out of the box and is probably on the floor of some warehouse or truck somewhere.  I found the rest of the small parts in the box and the larger parts still in the clam shell package but without the one retaining clip the system is useless.The product is too inexpensive to bother with a return.  If I find a retaining clip that will work (I do have one to compare with) then I can use it.That said Ill say again the Straplok System is a great product.

A1EX4410F46C8O,B0002CZVXM,Matt32 LIGHT WEIGHT,A little story to back these locks integrity.  I installed them on a Korean made Washburn WG-587v.  Incredible guitar after tweaking.  I did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying.  The strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder.  The screw had ripped out of the horn of the guitar!  The screw tore through about a half inch of solid wood (and I epoxy all my screws in) before the strap lock broke.  Amazing.Nice tough hardware.  The only complaint I have is that you must use screws with small heads if you choose not to use the stock screws provided.  Easy to install just unscrew your stock strap holder and screw in the lock holder.  Attach the lock to your strap and BAM quick release system.  Fast to take on and off of your guitar.I would suggest getting a tough thick leather strap with a nice reinforced eye to install the quick release button in cheap lightweight straps will eventually start to tear.  Also the button can be a slight pain to get on certain straps.I have now switched over to DiMarzio clip lock straps instead of the leather straps with Dunlop locks for many reasons and I am very happy but this product is GRADE A! I always felt 100% secure with these straplocks.  Our bass player uses some expensive (and heavy) Fender basses and he loves these strap locks.,Great locks,1299542400,03 8 2011,Good

A10H2F00ZOT8S2,B0002CZVXM,Mike C,Im in love with the dual design system! It works extremely well and allows me to switch between straps easily and quickly. There is one downside to this system as the strap that is used will be fairly far away from the guitar itself. Which might not be a bad thing considering wear and tear on the guitar from the strap. There was one hiccup while putting this together for the first time. One component which was this thin but big washer was pretty hard to install and the directions werent much help either. The directions did have it on there where it is supposed to go but I didnt know the name of the piece nor could I readily find it in there. After that I installed this into my new guitar and strap and I was ready to go. I HIGHLY recommend this! It is much easily to switch out straps w/o the possibility of striping the screws or boring into the screw hole and cracking some of the wood in the process.,GREAT Straplok system!,1382918400,10 28 2013,Best
A3PGQWCSJPCYDH,B0002CZVXM,Minh Pham,Ive been using these Fender straplocks over the last year:Fender 099 0818 300 F Straplock ChromeThe problem with those is that they use screws to secure that part that is on the strap itself and the screw will slowly back itself out and you get yourself a disaster. Ive decided to try these because they use a dual system: you can use the lock on your strap or just use your regular strap without the locking mechanism. Ive only been using these for a week but so far I like them much better than Fenders. I think I will replace all Fender straplocks with these.I do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality and the screw heads will strip if youre not careful. When I was installing these strap nuts I screw in a half turn at a time and applied lots of pressure so that the the head wont strip. If you can get over the installation you got yourself a pretty good locking strap.,Better than Fenders strap locks,1388188800,12 28 2013,Good
A2T372SGRFAWYP,B0002CZVXM,MK Hill MK Hill,I have used Dunlop Straplocks for 32 years. I bought the original style years ago for my Strat Les Paul and Partscaster; the last two having the most weight.These things have lasted through gigging and anything else i can throw at them with no problem. I ordered strap pins only a few months ago to put on a few more recent guitars and one of the push button locks finally went out. It was on the strap I used the most for the heavier guitars so I got some mileage out of that thing. I ordered a whole set of new ones here last month and put the locks on a new strap and the buttons on another guitar.I suggest these over the other brands - watch what touring bands use. These things lay flat and there are no protruding parts to catch. If you happen to be without a strap with locks on it these new pins can be used like regular pins but are larger so a strap will be pretty much secure.The price is good price them anywhere else and include shipping.

A3GH47E9FF8WN1,B0002CZVZK,K. Beach KRB,Ive been playing the uke since before they became popular again and must confess I own a quiver full of the addictive things (ranging from plywood beaters to a solid wood art object with an electric in between). Over the years Ive tried several different brands of string. The truth is there was nothing wrong with any of them. Its just that the Martin M600 strings seem a little bit more compliant than the others and this allows me to tease out a bit more articulation and tone. Given that string changing is a frequent occurrence with multiple instruments to fuel the Martin string sets relatively low cost is a nice bonus.,The Best of the Lot,1314748800,08 31 2011,Best
A2N4QZ92NBKJZZ,B0002CZVZK,Phaeton,Great guitar companies dont always make (or sell under their aegis) the best strings. I love my Teles but I cant stand Fender strings. Likewise I love my Martin ukulele but trying these strings for the second time I had the same conclusion as I did the first; Aquilas are far better. Aquilas have a more organic feel and a fuller richer sound. The Martins begin to hold their tune sooner - Aquilas take a couple of days or more - but the sound is thinner and the feel isnt nearly as friendly. The approximately 3 dollar price difference is not for me worth the lesser satisfaction even on my least expensive ukes. Considering how seldom one usually changes uke strings the higher-priced Aquilas still seem to be worth the extra couple of bucks. Use the Martins (or any cheaper string) when you are working on your uke put the stress of repeatedly de-tuning and re-tuning on them. Then switch to Aquilas for playing. Some may like the Martins but few wont love the Aquilas.,Aquila is better,1390089600,01 19 2014,Average

A2XXBZPQT5EXHV,B0002CZW0Y,Darren ONeill,When I bought these I was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording.  Once these are in position they work just fine the problem is that getting them into position can be harder than it looks.  The device clamps onto a microphone stand and then you adjust the goose neck to get the filter where you need it.  The filter and the goose neck are fairly heavy and as such it was often a struggle to get the filter where I wanted it and to keep it there.On the plus side the device looks nice and professional and it has held up over three years of use.,Will Give You Better Recordings But Can Be A Pain,1382745600,10 26 2013,Good

A1AU5K3JMPS3UQ,B0002CZW0Y,Eric,Pop filter works great. This really eliminated many subtle flaws I had with audio recording. Granted you can make a make-shift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon.

A2RI4QE6EO29CA,B0002CZW0Y,J. F. Hindy,Wow the reviews for this thing are a little ridiculous eh? Some people pay for silver and expect gold ;)Okay so I bought this because I do app review videos for a blog and my Blue Snowball mic was picking up the awful pop sounds that this is supposed to filter hard P hard T hard B S and a few others. So I got this. Here are my pros and cons:Pros1. It works. I tested in Sony Vegas pro with and without the filter. The pop sound is completely removed with the filter. Which means it does what it was designed to do. 5-stars. It does not affect voice volume at all just smooths those rough edges in your speech :D2. It looks nice. Attached to my Blue Snowball it looks like a professional product. It doesnt really matter since I work from home and not in a public place but its nice to know I can show it to people and it looks nice3. The clamp bendable arm and everything work appropriately. The clamp is designed to hold onto a bar and not a flat surface. So mounting this to say a desk probably wont be a stable as attached to a round thing like the stem to a mic.4. I dont know why people think this isnt sturdy...I mean youre not going to the local rink and playing hockey with the darn thing. The build quality is quite excellent considering that its 2 fragile screens attached to plastic and metal.Cons1. Its pretty big. I used to shorten the stem on my Blue Snowball and stash it in a cubby hole in my hutch desk for easy storage. I cant do that anymore with this pop filter on it. Now its become a permanent member of the front of my desk.Outside of this thing doubling the space my Snowball takes up I have no complaints about this pop filter. It works well it attaches nicely it does what it is supposed to do it looks nice and the quality is good. This should be the last pop filter I have to buy for a long time.,Good for Home Use,1370822400,06 10 2013,Best

A11E4FWMN9BXJD,B0002CZW0Y,Josh Adams Rock Crushes Paper,Yes you can make your own pop filter at home but you dont want to.  Why else would you be reading this?  Besides it wont look this good.Ive purchased three pop filters thus far in the last four months.  The most recent one I purchased was NOT this one.  I wish it was.  I thought Id try something different just to see the differences.  Well I can tell you that there are significant differences between this and some of the others featured here.The bottom clamp on this one features a rubber piece that grips the metal pole that you attach to.  The competitors that Ive tried do not.  If you do not have this rubber piece any clamp will tend to slip down the pole and not grip properly.  This is a huge mistake as this makes using a pop filter on a boom stand impossible.  Fortunately Nady placed this rubber piece on its clamp so this has never been an issue.The only complaint I have is the screen has actually popped out of the plastic ring a couple times.  A single dot of superglue fixed that.Compared to the other pop filters Ive seen and used this one is perfectly suited for any microphone and at a reasonable price you cant beat it.And yes pop filters ARE A MUST with condenser microphones.

It attracts a good amount of dust the screen tends to mess up (which caused me to tear the first screen) & the goose neck tends to unwrap its self out of place. It also gets shakey so I tend to have to screw it back in. Other than that its a decent pop filter but not for the price. Under $10 wouldve been better.

It seems quite servicable.  It is a double filter and attaches to my stand well enough.  The arm is just a little weak butit does stay put if you just dont bump it.  I guess there is a balance between stiffness and ease of possitioning it.  I think possitioning it would be a little easier if the arm was just a little stiffer.I can blow on it directly (not quite as hard as blowing out a cake full of candles) and I feel nothing on the other side and hear no wind rumble in my mic.So then Im gonna keep it and use it till it rots or gets lost.,Good Unit- Does the Job,1306454400,05 27 2011,Good

I really like the way the clamp connector is rubberized to protect the finish of your mic stand. And being that it is rubberized it allows you to adjust the filter to the mic without having to loosen everything up because rubber has an inherent &#34;give.&#34; And this is where the flexible arm allows you to fine tune the filters proximity to the singer allowing you to do what you do best -- Sing!

Because the new acoustic-electric classical I received as a gift has an end-pin outlet I bought the Spectraflex with the right angle connector.  Although I have been using the cable for only a few weeks I am very impressed.  The connections on all the guitars and basses on which Ive used it are sure with no loss of signal no crackles.  Perhaps most impressive is the fact that I can turn the right angle connector around and never have any change of signal.  Finally I can be confident that when I play something will consistently come out of the amplifier.  By the way the old-school tweed look is a plus too.,Outstanding Cable!,1288224000,10 28 2010,Best

This cable is built to be extremely durable is made in the USA and comes with a lifetime warrantee. The 20 gauge construction and rugged nylon braiding makes for a very low noise cable and the connectors are very secure and feel quite substantial (especially compared to a cheaper Fender cable I had been using that required almost constant tightening.) Though Spectraflex cables are not the least expensive (nor the most expensive) they are a great value and I am definitely a fan.

These have worked well quiet no handling noise seem well built (I treat cables well so I dont really test them with under tough circumstances) and hopefully will remain in their spot for the foreseeable future.  They are used 6 nights a week and after 50 uses no problems.  I recommend them (plus for live the fabric cables in different colors are great for easily identifying which is which for a road crew member who might not know audio well.).

A3DJZHSAW4ANH0,B0002D0096,Chandler,Ive had this little amplifier for a few weeks and I couldnt ask for a better practice amp. Its amazing how loud it gets in an otherwise quiet room but itll get drowned out pretty quickly when you add competing sounds. Its rugged and portable and its fun to play around with some of the effects. The fact that it runs on batteries is a huge plus.,Exactly as advertised,1355702400,12 17 2012,Best
A1L7M2JXN4EZCR,B0002D0096,David G,Might work well for recording too when you take the output jack.  Speaker is acceptable quality but cant be compared with a Fender amp as this one has 5 watts and a small speaker and the other has 10-20 watts.  Im opting for the convenience of the size.  I got this after getting a couple smaller amps and headphone monitor plugs since it has both and was better sound with good effects.  I like the brit setting.  I sound like a rock star with it.  Good product for practice or recording.  You could get away with microphone to amplify it for a gig.  But for around the same price you could get a Fender amp.  This product works for me and the quality is pretty good.  Other mini amps and similar accessories are toys compared to this.,Nice portable amplifier for practice,1382400000,10 22 2013,Best
A2IDOKLAT1MP8X,B0002D0096,Jared Burdick JBurd,There are several types of practice amps. High end modlers (Line 6 G Dec Vox VT) that can still run $400+ and are typically overloaded with features. The low end tubes (Fender Blues Junior Bug V22 Peavey Valveking etc). These typically are more stripped down (in features not neccessarily quality). And then there are the micros. I always thought they were just a notch above toys the sort of amps found in a prepackaged guitar set up from Wally World at Christmas.Boy was I wrong...I needed a portable amp for my son to take to and from practice after school. It was important to me that he could schlepp his own gear. Hes not a big kid so even 15lb. amps are pushing it(plus a gig bag and school back pack). That was initially what brought me to the Micro. Not sound or features just the smallest possible amp for my little virtuoso. Turns out this is an AMAZING amp. The tone destroys the Line 6 and the features crush the Vox Pathfinder (6watt?) or Bug V12. And the Fender frontman - not even in the ballpark.Each of the models are distinct. The cleans are sparkly (more trebly) and the high gain models are very articulate. Obviously this isnt a loud amp but thats not all bad. You can get everything this amp has to offer at reasonable volumes. It also can be battery powered (the life is suprisingly long) includes a regular wall plug headphone jack built in tuning fork (which is kind of lame) and a series of onboard effects that can be run simultaneously. For example I was able to crank up the delay and tremelo and pull off some Dick Dale surpher licks with suprising accuracy.Dont let the size fool you. I honestly thought it was nothing more than a toy and I couldnt have been more wrong.  There are several big websites and its tough to find any negatives about this amp. Quality sounding and durable for a great price.Oh - and the red - if you can find it - looks pretty sweet too.,For the price - an easy 5 stars,1308096000,06 15 2011,Best
A1HQN6CNAO683Y,B0002D0096,Mr. Kipp M. Webb The Kipster,Great little amp. I had to take my Ampeg Jet in for a maintenance and I just love this little practice amp. I enjoy using it with both my Fender Strat and my Rickenbacker.,Little Giant,1386460800,12 8 2013,Best
A2B1KICX3RPRX3,B0002D0096,ng11 ng11,It is a fun little practice amp and I agree with the praise it gets. The positives have been covered so Ill point out a few (minor) things I dont like.First of all the power button is on the back which is annoying. The rest of the controls are on top why do I have to grope around the back to find the most important button. Plus I keep it in a cabinet so I have to pull it out to turn it on and off.Next! I wish theyd just name the settings &#34;clean&#34; &#34;overdrive&#34; &#34;distortion&#34; and so on. JC Clean Black Panel Brit combo and R-Fier mean nothing to me.Then theres another minor annoyance that the input is recessed. A 90 degree angle plug wont fit unless you run it around the back.Lastly the amp is solid and rugged but that means its heavy. Not heavy like I cant pick it up just heavy for something called a micro amp.None of these are deal breakers just things I find annoying. Overall I have to say I prefer my VOX mini 3.,Nice little amp with a few annoyances,1404345600,07 3 2014,Good
A19Q4B515ENF9C,B0002D0096,Richard L. Chism,I bought this amp to replace a Squier SP-10 that came with my guitar.  The Squier had no effects just a clean channel and an overdrive button.  I couldnt afford a bunch of pedals but I wanted some effects so I could get cool sounds from my electric guitar.  I saw the reviews for this little amp on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It is Awesome!  For such a small amp the output is plenty loud for practicing at home and it runs on batteries too so I can take it anywhere.  The effects are better than Id hoped for.  This is certainly not for the pro who performs onstage or with a drummer but for an intermediate level guitarist (like me) who just plays for his own pleasure or to please his family this is the amp to get.  It has several modeling functions and you can choose between chorus flanger phaser or tremelo while still adding either reverb or delay.  Im one of the growing number of retirees who decided to pick up the guitar and learn more about it now that I have the time.  I dont need the deafening stacks that the kids like.  I love this amp.,Awesome Effects and a Great Sound,1381449600,10 11 2013,Best
A20EZ7E8WUH2GZ,B0002D0096,Shastastan Stan,This pupppy is pretty powerful just running off the batteries.  Weve used it on a couple of gigs an it worked well with the volume only half way up.  We are not guitar players and are not using guitars with it.  We are using an mp3 player for backup.  The sound is not quite as clear as we get with our Roland Cm-30 (so only 4 stars from me).  The micro cube is a lot easier to transport and set up and its nice not to have to load up cart to roll around.

A1L7M2JXN4EZCR,B0002D01IG,David G,Tone control didnt work so it was returned.  But it was pretty nice even though I felt the fret-board quality is higher on my 900 Gibson Les Paul but what can you expect.  If I had to order it again I would pay 140 more and get the SG 400 which has the quality pickups.  The sound is lets say... average.  Good beginner guitar or a guitar that can be upgraded with new pickups.  The bolt-in neck didnt bother me but the SG 400 doesnt have that which is another reason I would step up next time.  Shape is ok.  Purely subjective.  I like the solid Les Paul shape now a little better since its more conservative.  But the size is good and almost more comfortable than the Les Paul style.  Cant believe they can make a good guitar like this for only 160 bucks.  Also even though I was tempted with the faded finish the glossy finish is really nice.  This guitar will make a player proud.,Nice finished guitar,1382400000,10 22 2013,Good

A2XB18IXOKUV82,B0002D01IG,Norb,I bought this at Guitar Center and now wish that I hadnt.  The reason I said this is that I would have rather saved the taxes but oh well. Now on to the guitar itself.....This was the second of my three Epiphone guitars and for someone who isnt a professional musician I still want to sound like one.  The sound from this SG is true to its big brother from Gibson. Awesome crunch and great sustainability.  I can take or leave the kill pot.  The electronics mainly the switch could use some replacing.  Im not complaining I just noticed some extra noise when switching pickups..  For $169 you cant expect to have the top of the line.To sum it up I love this guitar.  I keep in E flat tuning and it stays.  To me a guitar with this sound and crunch deserves to drop its tuning a little.,Amazing sound for under $200,1394668800,03 13 2014,Best

I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc. This was was better then I expected. It is sturdy outside and nice fusion inside with a tight but not too tight fit. In other words great all around. I know it sits on a self with many other guitars when I take it in to the guitar guys so I am perfectly confident that it is well protected. and it is lockable (with key)If you are looking for a more then good case for your Epi LP just get this one.

The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it. Turns out thats actually impossible to do with this case unless you have an extra key... so dont worry.

A1MM26M78136ZP,B0002D01K4,fearn0evil,Its a tight fitting case. I am a proud owner of aEpiphone Les Paul Custom Proand it fits as snug as can be. When I ordered the case I assumed it would be made for my guitar. It arrived double boxed and wrapped in plastic. I am sure I received a new case. Being perfectly  protected as it was it hadnt a mark on it so.As far as the construction it not a flight case by any means. It looks as though it will hold up to at least some abuse and still do its job to protect the guitar. My guitar does not move in the case due to its perfect fit. With this said over time there is a possibility of wear. I would predict the buckles may be the first to fail. And then handle doesnt look as durable as it could be  well see on that.Overall this is the case for the Epiphone Les Paul. I saw the Gibson case and I just dont see them as superior enough to justify paying more. I am satisfied with my purchase and I think most people would be. Five stars for now. I will edit in the future if necessary.,Tight Fit,1377388800,08 25 2013,Best

A3BMI7VGJT60Y7,B0002D02IU,Autumn,Summary for those who dont want to read the whole thing: This is more than worth the money. If youre a beginner looking for a first guitar or if youre experienced and are searching for a backup/travel option or anything like that get this. Do not hesitate. A cheap guitar doesnt ALWAYS mean a POS!Alright full story/review:So when I was a kid up until my early teens my (insanely talented and self-taught) older brother helped me learn how to play guitar. I got pretty decent but somewhere along the way I stopped and Ive regretted it basically every day ever since then. Recently I decided to stop internally griping about it and realized I should actually DO something about it. So here I am.Having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists I have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and I have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars (like a typical beginners First Act). I knew there was a middle ground and I was determined to find it. I got way more than I bargained for.I began my quest knowing that my funds were limited. There was no way I could afford to dive right in and buy a high end top of the line Fender or Martin like I had had the benefit of learning on back in the day. I knew I had to go cheap at least for now. I began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars. After an exhaustive amount of research I chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos Id pulled up on YouTube were excellent. Plus Epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general.Despite the positive reviews I was still a bit leery; buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble. Even if it sounds nice and plays well sometimes a perfectly solid functional instrument just doesnt FEEL right. As I went through the checkout I silently reminded myself that I could send it back for any reason. I went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility Id just have to bite the bullet and buy something better even if costlier.Well it arrived earlier this week and I am not disappointed. I certainly didnt expect perfection and I was convinced that I would find some kind of error if only cosmetic with such a cheap guitar. I am here to tell you that I have not found anything wrong with it. Even if I had (unless it drastically affected the sound/playability of the instrument) it would still be worth the price.Along with the guitar I bought some new strings (Martins) because 9/10 times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable. I see that some of the other reviewers disagree. Maybe their strings were older or maybe its just preference I dont know. All I can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded/old. Shockingly enough the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box! It doesnt seem to have any trouble staying in tune either. All of that being said it wouldnt hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe. I mean Im sure that when I do finally put the Martins on Ill be even more mind-blown than I already am with the way it sounds.This guitar has a full rich sound plays comfortably (the low action helps!) and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets. Oh and contrary to what other reviews have said - YES it DOES have a truss rod. While were talking about its positives lets not ignore the fact that its also super attractive with its shiny black finish. There isnt much about it that would give away its price. No its not a $1000 guitar but it certainly doesnt play like a $100 guitar either! I dont regret this purchase at all. Even in the future when I progress and upgrade I will definitely be keeping this lovely gem!If youre still unsure do what I did and listen to some demos on YouTube. I doubt youll be disappointed. (Pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the GearWire YouTube channel did. He clearly doesnt know what hes talking about and I as well as everyone else in the comments section was sure to express my feelings about that haha! One user even claimed Epiphone should sue him!) Check out the video reviews by the users/companies GoldHat3 SamAshMusic GigGear and ShadowFW.My only complaint about this guitar is that I didnt buy it sooner!Good luck on your search I hope this review has helped!,This will more than suffice,1376006400,08 9 2013,Best
A3394J1F9CN9W5,B0002D02IU,Charles Forquignon Cyrus Blades,First off; let me start by saying I bought this guitar because it was only $100 and I was board on my deployment and wanted something to brush up on before I return home.I DID NOT: expect good quality sound or comfortably from this guitar.I DID: want something cheap I could toss around and use out here in the desert without worrying about it getting beaten up or trashed.When I unboxed this guitar I was floored! The hardware is much higher quality than I had expected by far. The strings it came with werent complete crap but I swapped them out for my favorite set of strings: Ernie Ball 2406 Ernesto Palla Nylon Black and Silver Classical strings. The guitar sings beautifully; the tone is rich and vibrant.Its quite comfortable to play I have no problems playing up to the 16th fret without this guitar having a cut away. Im not a big fan of the pick guard that has the Epiphone E on it so I will probably end up removing it; but the sunburst is really nice looking. I have received many compliments on the look of it already.OVER ALL: this guitar is a really great instrument for the price tag. GET IT!Also; Im buying a hard case to take it home or shipping this guitar back home to myself because I want to keep it as part of my collection. My original thought was to buy this guitar and leave it out here at the Rec tent for other people to use after Im gone. Even if I do decide to leave it out here; Ill be buying another one when I get home!,Absolutly an amazing guitar for $100,1386979200,12 14 2013,Best
A8MTE6SIYM0GY,B0002D02IU,Fletcher Chambers Jr.,This is NOT my first guitar. Nor am I breathless Epiphone supporter shouting how this guitar is the sonic equal of Taylors and Martins. Its not. Heres what it is: An exceedingly well-constucted AMAZINGLY playable guitar. Fit finish feel and action were all VERY nice... Sound on the other hand? Lets face it. Its plywood all around. It SOUNDS like plywood. But that doesnt distract from the fact that its a great guitar for $100 bucks.Its a fine &#34;first&#34; guitar. Its a great beach/camping/cabin guitar. Leave it in your car to practice at lunch. Leave it in the office. ANY guitar is better than no guitar... And this guitar is better than a LOT of other entry level guitars.Seriously consider changing strings the second you take it out of the box... New premium strings DO make a difference.If your expectations are for a playable rugged affordable guitar you wont be disappointed. If sound quality is your primary concern well... You are going to have to spend more than a hundred bucks to be happy.For my desired application this guitar was great... Im very happy with it and would buy it again in a heartbeat.,This review is different...,1397779200,04 18 2014,Good

AR6CAR106LX2Y,B0002D02IU,TIMOTHY A. BILLINGSLEY BamaGuitar,Well constructed with quality woods saddle/nut and bracing. Neck and frets are straight level and do not snag. This guitar rings like a bell stays in tune and is light weight. Do not let the low price fool you but do not expect the guitar to come set up to your tastes. Any guitar that you buy will need to be adjusted to your style of play. The strings may be too high or too light or whatever just be ready to do a tiny bit of work to get it like you want it then it will serve you well.

AONGA3BHTK0EG,B0002D02RQ,CHUS01 Fan,I tried this but ended up going back to Tortex.  I like the satin finish on the Tortex better and the way it bends.

APEJ8EJCC8PQ8,B0002D02RQ,F. Jones,Guitar picks make a huge part of your tone.  Especially on acoustic.  These are the best acoustic picks on the market today in my opinion.  They have a long life and do brighten your tone.

A362IZKSMV6MA8,B0002D02RQ,Garot M. Conklin,These are nice I like the 1.14 rigidity and these are just fine for me... you will wear them out on acoustics though if you are a more aggressive player as I am.  Once these are worn as with most picks they sound considerably different.  Much more grainy and tin-y but that may be a plus for you?  I also like the side edges for a real mellow and / or speeding picking style.  They stay in your fingers well.,its a Pick,1400025600,05 14 2014,Good

A23HJIRA5PIMG0,B0002D02RQ,Michael A. Rammel sixxstring,I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I dont know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.Buy em!!!!,Good picks but...,1347926400,09 18 2012,Bad
A2O2UE0UTPOB0Q,B0002D02RQ,Michael D Burwell,I love the pick attack with these.  I have used almost everything out there over 20 years of playing and have settled on this pick as my go-to choice for acoustic guitar.,Best picks on phosphor bronze long-life strings,1356652800,12 28 2012,Best
ADH0O8UVJOT10,B0002D02RQ,StormJH1,Didnt think Id be compelled to review something like a guitar pick but the Dunlop Ultex has really impressed me thus far.  I use the .60 thickness which is equivalent to the orange plastic Dunlop pick.  The orange pick is my favorite for acoustic and most electric playing but they do wear down and fray on the edges and have a little more friction that Id like.This Ultex seems very resistant to wear and has surprisingly little drag over the string.  I find the matte finish very easy to grip and hold.  It gives just enough to use for smooth strumming while being rigid enough for individual notes.Some reviewers have noted that they crack after some use.  If that turns out to be a problem I might reconsider my review.

AXXYMIJBD0J9G,B0002D070I,Chuck,I like the fact that it can be &#34;partially&#34; installed with the cord coming out of the sound hole or it can be easily installed on a more permanent basis by cutting the cord to length and running it inside the guitar body through the end pin hole (which will have to be enlarged a bit).  Either way once plugged in it sounds great.  This pickup maintains the great acoustic sound of my guitar a Blueridge BR-160.  I installed some Fishman &#34;under the saddle&#34; pickups in a few Martin guitars and this pickup sounds just as good if not better.  If you dont mind the pickup visible in the sound hole this is the way to go.  Another nice thing about it is the ease of changing out the batteries as compared to the undersaddle type pickups where the batteries are attached to the inside body of the guitar.,Excellent product!,1369008000,05 20 2013,Best
A39PQ7QR2JFXLV,B0002D070I,Ian Shillington Doc Shillington,This is not a bad product just not great.  As soon as I received it I installed it on my custom made Grit Laskin Guitar and played with it for over two hours.  Installation was fast and only took a couple of minutes.  My problems with it are 3 fold:  #1.  Sounds just a bit tinny = too much on the high end and not an equal amount of bass.  #2.  A small complaint is that you have to dismantle the entire installation just to change the batteries and I couldnt get mine to work in passive mode.  #3.  And the biggest complaint is that the volume control is difficult to get to when youre performing on stage.  You have to stick your finger in the hole on the top side of the strings and fumble around trying to change the volume which is very sensitive so all of sudden you can be too loud or too soft.  Like I said it is not a bad product just not top notch and definitely not for professionals.  If youre just fooling around at home or recording at home it is fine and will do the job for you.  BUT!!!  If youre a pro youll want to spend double the money and get an L. R. Baggs M-80.  The M-80 gives you the truest sound (unbelievable) works in passive mode and is very easy to change the volume control.  Sincerely Doc,Not Bad,1339459200,06 12 2012,Average

A3ZBLSAPZB9LE,B0002D0B4K,Rick Holly Rick Holly,The reviewer who wrote that that these are cheap foam worth $5.00 doesnt understand or appreciate the quality of these speaker isolators. A/B these with some $5.00 cheap foam and you will realize how good these Auralex isolators work. I am using a pair of Behringer Truth active speakers that weigh 33 pounds each. These isolators not only support them very well but solved a big problem I had. It seems my speakers were audio coupling with the console they were placed on making the console vibrate with the spaekers and muddy up the lower fequencies.My problem started when I noticed that my mixes sounded good on other systems except for the bass frequencies around 80-125 HZ. Apparently my Behringer speakers were not accurately reproducing that fequency range and I was EQing that range badly to compensate. I didnt hear it when I mixed my Hafler M-1 speakers. I was about to give up on the Behringer Truth speakers but I really thought that they sounded excellent on every other frequency and are very detailed in every other range. The Behringers also had all the power I needed (active speakers) and can be played really loud in my studio without any distortion. Except for what I can only describe as a muddy or not clearly detailed low end I love these speakers. Fortunately I was at a friends studio (a great pro studio) and I saw that he was using the Auralex Isolators under his speakers. He said he loved them. I bought them and placed them under my speakers and remixed a project I had been working on. WOW!! What a difference. It was an immediate difference. The bass is now nicely detailed and that muddy tone is no longer there. I had to reajust the EQ on the lower frequencies (cut them back to almost flat)on the new mix. I immediately bought a 2nd set for my small Hafler speakers. Why take a chance that they were also not reproducing accurately. These isolators are a great product and problem solver that saved me from buying new speakers and discovering that I still had the same problem. Cheap foam?? I dont think so.,Excellent product.,1320883200,11 10 2011,Best
A3DGMJN91IUKGU,B0002D0B4K,Tommy B.,Some will argue that these are not necessary for your monitors however as somebody who has worked in music for more than half their life I can assure you that whereas theyre not life or death they do make a significant improvement on the listening process especially in your project studio. No theyre not going to make your music sound any better but they will give you a more detailed and accurate bass response when your monitoring. Even cooler is the fact that the pads come with 2 extra pieces of padding that will essentially let you customize the position of the monitors in that you can angle them up or down ever-so-slightly. Lastly although my monitors fit perfectly on the pads I cant help but to think that if my monitors were any larger I would need a second pair especially if they were positioned horizontally. All and all overpriced or not; they really make a world of difference.,An Absolute Necessity For Your Monitors,1362268800,03 3 2013,Best

AA169UZEJYAV1,B0002D0C1C,Luckystar,I have tried different brands and weights of strings in search of the ones that would give my guitar a clear bright yet robust sound and I found that in the Martin MSP 4050 SP strings.

A23NSKTMSPPBTR,B0002D0C1C,Wayne,Martin makes a variety of good sounding strings and these are toward the light end.  The sound is bright but lacks a fullness found with some of the heavier strings such asMartin MSP4150 SP Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings Light-Medium.The custom light are easier to play and have a bright tone to them but can make a guitar sound like a cheaper model compared to the Light-Medium. Some disadvantages to the thinner strings are that they can limit your dynamics. If you strum harder they are more stretchy and the tuning will be less consistent changing the tone for the same reason a bend would. If you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant one.On the other hand compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound the brightness can make an instrument sound quite good.Depending on your style these might be a good choice. If you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable these might seem more at home.  If you are used to Martin medium strings but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things you might like these too but when you pick up a guitar with the Martin Medium strings you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale one.I wouldnt say I dislike these and I wouldnt quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs. But as an all around choice there are better sounding ones from Martin. But its a moot point if you dont feel comfortable playing them. Make sure to read a variety of reviews before deciding because there are other equally valid viewpoints just as each player is unique.,A lightweight contender,1308614400,06 21 2011,Average

A39KDVU5JAXJIF,B0002D0CAI,Harry An Harry,Long story short this string set has a strong metallic character which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it but for me absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar so by its nature it sounds mellow warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtops neck position WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes it is that bad you cant do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so definitely avoid this string.,I feel like playing an active EMG on my Fender guitar...,1372291200,06 27 2013,Worst

As time went on and my guitar skills grew I needed a pick that was sturdy and wouldnt flex to play more intricate and detailed songs.The tortex purples are my favorite and theyre the thickest ones I can find. I like the soft sandy feel of these. They dont slip out of your hand easily and because theyre so thick they take a long time to wear out.,My favorite picks,1354838400,12 7 2012,Best

A21Q29J3ZWPDNP,B0002D0CEO,From Detroit,Yes.  The 1.0mm Tortex picks are BLUE!  I was quite surprised at the number of reviewers that complained for not getting a multi-color pack.  If anyone has ever been to ANY guitar shop the Tortex Picks are all color coded!Anyway Ive been playing guitar for about 15 years.  Ive been using the Blue Tortex picks for about 14.  At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on.  Teardrops were too small; Fender brand were too slippery; Guitar Center brand wore out too quickly; the Jim Dunlop nylon picks just felt too weird to me.  The 1.0mm Tortex give just the right sound on the attack dont feel too flimsy in my fingers (I keep a tight grip) and the grip on them is far superior to any on the market (gator grips feel too porous for me.)

A2JQWSA0GPVSQN,B0002D0CEO,GamerBoy,Whatever size you are looking for Dunlop is the best option. It lasts long sounds great and feels very nice. It is probably the most favored pick among all companies. I recommend the orange one for beginners and in general would not go much higher than the green ones because when it gets too heavy it does not feel to comfortable anymore and does not sound as well but it is totally up to what you want. Either way Dunlop is the best and for a great price.,My Favorite Picks,1347753600,09 16 2012,Best

They have good tension but still sound nice with my acoustic and the grip is great.  Its almost like a microscopic layer of felt is on these.  It sucks when your hands are cold and the pick keeps slipping out of your fingers...you dont want to keep licking your fingers or breather warm air on them and these are easy to hold onto no matter the condition.,Very sturdy and easy to grip,1291075200,11 30 2010,Best

A1MI9FDCNB3CMR,B0002D0CEO,Jorge Barbarosa the_bassist,If you thought a pick is a pick (like I once did long ago) you would probably come to realize that it would be a mistake to assume that position as your playing and playing strength increases in attack and/or complexity.I use the Dunlop Tortex 1.14mm Purples.Early on in my playing I was using thin to medium picks but read in a guitar magazine along with hearing from several friends that a heavy pick is better. Why? After messing about I found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack.  The interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give or slackens when attacking hard. With a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibility.I tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid 80s.I like the Dunlops feel grip and durability. They hold up for a very long time. How long? I have had some last a few years. They are an incredible bargain given the long lasting durability.My students use them too I dont demand it but I do stress the control aspects with picks of different gauges.Highly recommended. You wont be disappointed.,Quality,1351900800,11 3 2012,Best
A2BJZRLR99YW75,B0002D0CEO,JuanKiDaz,Finally decided in getting the 1.00mm picks because I dont like them too thin or too thick this was the perfect gauge I was looking and hoping for.

A4XWMOFB1HY04,B0002D0CEO,Mr. GrvThang,The thickness of the pick you use is a matter of personal preference. For my style the .60 Dunlop Tortex is perfect.  The surface is matte and not too slick.  I dont think I have ever worn one down to being unusable; they seem to last forever (or until theyre lost).  Ive tried other brands and picks made of other materials but I always come back to these.

A46D3MTB5LIUY,B0002D0CEO,Ocean Blue,I always keep a lot of these on hand.  These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals).  Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks.  These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used.  For example I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musicians Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks.  The weight is great for my style of playing.  They seem more durable than other brands.  Theyre inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand.

A1YBZOWO2RBIUZ,B0002D0CEO,Pantanga34,I love these picks for playing my acoustic. They give such a nice crisp tone and the perfect amount of flex for playing acoustic.

A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B0002D0CEO,Robert I. Hedges,As a kid I learned to play the trombone proficiently but my heart wasnt really in it so I took up the guitar which I love. I played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time. I recently started playing again and was looking for the perfect pick for classic rock (I have an old Ibanez and a Les Paul Custom) and have tried several picks in that quest. There are several I have liked (and several that I havent) but thus far my favorite is the 1.0mm Tortex (blue) picks. They have a very nice almost powdery matte feel that minimizes slippage and they just dont break though the 1.0s are fairly stiff. Depending on what you are playing there are various thicknesses available and most people will find something suitable for their personal preferences. I wont say that I will never try anything else but thus far I find myself picking up my 1.0 Tortex more than other picks.,Durable And Dont Slip: Whats Not To Love?,1344902400,08 14 2012,Best

They are so grippy I havent broken a single one yet they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio so its hard to loose them but I still do. If you have like a child nephew niece sibling or parent that plays guitar or bass you cant go wrong with getting these for them or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little Fender picks that break if you strum a chord and if you are lucky enough not to break them they just slip out of your hands while youre playing. They are a little thin for rhythm playing however and I recommend the .88 mm picks for that.,These guitar picks are great. If you have a guitarist that is in your family get him a pack or 2. He will thank you.,1378339200,09 5 2013,Good

My favorites are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks which are very similar to these.  I guess when it comes right down to it these are essentially the same I just have more of the Brain Picks at this point so I use them more.  But these Dunlop nylon picks are excellent.  Theyre almost impossible to drop they sound and feel just right to me and they last seemingly forever.  Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks.,Great!,1373241600,07 8 2013,Best

A2U7ZM8TAJUFPQ,B0002D0CGC,Brandon K. Rush,Ever since I started playing the guitar Ive used the nylon Dunlop picks. Theyre better in a thicker size (1.0mm or larger) but the .73mm size is about the same thickness as a regular Fender pick. Theyre flexible and easy to pick with but the biggest plus about the nylon picks is that they will NOT break. Youd almost have to melt one of these things with a lighter to harm it -- so one pack of them will last you yeeeeears.Also of note: the price keeps going up on these here on Amazon for some reason -- dont pay more than $3-4 for a pack of them as you can get them at your local music store for about that.,Good picks.,1306886400,06 1 2011,Good

A3MTR7P9PYAALX,B0002D0CGC,Craig Richard Gillette,I like thin picks myself and this one is VERY thin. You wontuse it all the time but every now and then it can be used in the right situation. If you are a player who is somewhat meat-fisted when it comes to playing and needs to take the edge off it is ideal. Also if you are doing very soft strumming on an acoustic guitar it is awesome. No power chords with this little guy but it is a good tool to have in the tool box when you need it. The non-slippery texture and its grippy textured surface of Dunlops is what I love about them the most it makes them easier to hold on to. I give them a thumbs up!,Very thin! But great for acoustic guitar strumming.,1347840000,09 17 2012,Best
A1MY8258SXRZ8M,B0002D0CGC,eatablog,Theyre just great.  Awesome for chord based songs.  If you need to pick individual notes/strings then you might want to go a bit thicker.

A10KH8EN77ZKWH,B0002D0CGC,H. Easter,Theyre very thin nylon picks. Theyre good for practicing the hand motions of strumming; they put up very little resistance so they train you to keep your hand stable. I still sometimes play with them since they give a really nice bright tone but I usually want something thicker in order to be able to flatpick melody lines in between strums. I also sometimes use them when practicing flatpicking since flatpicking with a really thin pick reveals things about your body mechanics that you dont notice with a thicker pick.Theyre great for what they are (thin flexible picks) and Amazon has the best price.,Good for learning to strum,1330992000,03 6 2012,Best

Ive tried almost every other pick on the market and they break far too easily.  Dunlops Nylon picks dont break and once you find the thickness that fits your needs youll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip.

A3V1A3C9DTLPME,B0002D0CGC,Peter Faden robilar5500,Ive been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as Ive been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60s are just a bit too thin but for more chord strumming style playing such as playing rhythm the .73s are perfect. They are flexible but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all youll get with a pristine tip. However theyre definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So i dont see how you can go wrong.,I use these picks for standard chord strumming.,1310774400,07 16 2011,Best
A1MCMSRNN2AS1F,B0002D0CGC,Picky,These Dunlop 88 mm picks are the right size not to big or too small.  Been using these for years.  Always good to have extras on hand and put into the cases.

A1LI9W7A0CYOHV,B0002D0CGC,Russ,I ordered these because I bought a variety pack of picks from Musicians Friend and there was one lonesome very thin celluloid pick in the pack. I loved how it quieted the strumming on my acoustic dreadnought so I went on the hunt for very thin picks. The celluloid one fell apart quickly so I wanted a better material.These white nylon picks should last a lot longer. The non-pointed end is all grippy (textured) so it doesnt work great if you like to use the more rounded corners of a pick but it does the job and I like it. The pointed end is very thin and slides off the strings nicely but you can still pick with it if youre combining picking and strumming.Ill keep using thicker picks for picking-only songs and for louder strumming but for more mellow strumming and to keep from bothering other folks in the house these are great.UPDATE: Ive been using them for more than a year now and they are pretty flimsy for picking notes in a mostly-strumming song... but you can do it. This is still my favorite pick for strumming. Hope this helps.,Just what I was looking for,1341446400,07 5 2012,Good
A2SKZZZBV1XYWP,B0002D0CGC,Sledman,OK so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. Ive been playing for about 30 years now and have used many different brands an types of pick. There is no 1 perfect pick for everything depending on what your playing and your playing style youll want to choose different thickness and materials. However I have found this line of pick to be my favorite and my general goto pick. My hands sweat and the textured grips on these do a fantastic job of keeping the pick in my hand on not on the floor. I also really like the Nylon material. It produces a softer sound without dampening the overall sound or volume of the guitar. I like the playability of the .88mm as its great for strumming rhythm at loud volume or picking blues. I Keep a stack of .60mm for a more raw folk like sound. In any case these picks are great and have been a staple in my kit for many many years and will continue to be.,Simply great picks.,1403568000,06 24 2014,Best
A3NMQFWLXPP8EV,B0002D0CGC,Tabasco24 The Cheese,These picks are nylon so each one will last you a couple of years (as long as you dont lose them!!) this is thicker than the .60mm so you can dig into the strings a little better but still a hair flimsier than the Snarling Dogs .73mm picks (I know theyre the same size but trust me these are &#34;flimsier&#34;) and the grip is ok.

A202CZ4PJH83G4,B0002D0CGW,Tinfoot,As a vast multitude of guitar players will solemnly agree we all have experienced the search for the personal Holy Grail of guitar picks.  I am no exception.  Dozens and dozens of makers styles shapes gages  materials  price ranges (oh ya the 30 dollar picks) you name it Ive tried it (even nail picking on metal strings).  Now if you are new to the &#34;perfect pick quest&#34; you must understand that picks are as subjective as scent with personal grip sound interaction a host of music ingredients making your Grail different.  However if you play a light metal-string acoustic (my main is an Aria AF tenor guitar) check out these Dunlops .60 Nylons.Even within the Dunlop line I have tried the different grips and thickness gages and after all said and done these relatively cheap picks are all that have remained standing as my first choice.  Just heavy enough to be heard unplugged without folding the pick around my thumb light enough to strum fluidly without yanking at my lighter strings just the right material to keep my low strings thumping and my high strings singing.  Even the Dunlop Nylon Max grip of the same .60 gage didnt acoustically perform quite the same.Would I try another pick if the chance was presented?  Sure most of us would since the quest for the Holy Grail never truly ends  but until then Dunlops .60 Nylon is without hesitation the closest thing I have gotten to pick perfection.,Seeking the Holy Grail of Picks,1397001600,04 9 2014,Best

My favorite picks for the last ~8 years are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks - theyre nylon picks that have a raspy cats tongue surface that makes it super easy to grip.Ive also had a few of these Gator Grip picks for a few years now and I like them quite a bit but theyre not my favorite.  I tend to use something around or just under 1 mm for electric and a bit less than that for acoustic.  These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them.

A3GHV54CDBCKO4,B0002D0CIK,cincinnatislim,Ive been using the Dunlop Delrin 500 2.0 picks.  Purple ones with the turtle/500 on them.  I thought I had found my pick.  Because they were so slippery I had to rough up each side to have enough texture to improve the grip (Id rub each flat side against the edge of a honing stone).  At the music store I stumbled on the Dunlop Gator Grip 2.0.  Yes they do offer a better grip (I think theyre still a little slippery but much better than the Delrin 500).  But since I solved that problem with the honing stone I was more curious.  So - again they are better grip wise but I was very surprised at the difference in tone.  They give a much mellower tone than the 500s and since Im using these with flat wound 12s on an archtop - the less bright sound often is a better tone overall.  500s seem to be a harder material and are brighter.  I dont know what the Gators are made of but I do like the difference in sound. Im not sure how theyd work on round wound strings - but great for jazz tones.,Extra mellow sound.

Early earlyfam,Ive been trying to find a pick which combines a good grip the right string resonance for strumming and enough stiffness for accurate picking and these picks might be the closest Ive found so far for my style of playing. Im a naturally hard strummer so I want a pick that I can hold more loosely strum more softly and still get enough clarity and volume. I want to give them 5 stars but I think that would only apply if they were perfect for strumming and picking - theyre very good for both but not quite what I would consider the ideal pick for me if one exists. If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks.

I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable and easy to control.Now the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable plinking sound that is audible through your amp.  If all youre playing is loud music this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.So too bad.  I think these are great picks but Id like them to be made of a softer material.,Good & Bad,1315440000,09 8 2011,Average
A22SZV0N4O2FQM,B0002D0CKI,Amazon Customer remo,I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. I generally use a Dunlop 1.0m pick but have to switch to a thinner pick for rhythm play. This of course can be very annoying especially if playing rhythm and lead parts in the same song.  These Big Stubby picks have solved that problem. They are easy to hold onto great for leads and because of the way they are shaped dont hang on to the strings like the regular picks do.  Great picks. Definitely worth the little extra they cost.,Great pick for all types of rock playing,1288828800,11 4 2010,Best
AB2G1XOBEGWK2,B0002D0CKI,Boiler98,So these picks are really nice but the picture is not what you will get.  These picks are translucent purple.  Other than the strange color they are good picks.

A3GHV54CDBCKO4,B0002D0CKI,cincinnatislim,I always find it interesting the different opinions about products.  Some dont like the sound others say these wear out in a day (really -- do you play for 24 hours?).  Some say that the grip is good.  Heres my take -- for what its worth.  Ive listened to these with hollow and semi hollow body guitars.  Round and flat wound strings.  My general take is that these picks give a better fuller rounder bigger tone overall.  Compared to the tortex style pick material (1 mm for the tortex).  Its a bit hard to determine if the sound comes from the material thickness or a combination of both.  Also note I play with the rounded edge not the tip.  So the grip in the center of these doesnt quite fit my grip style but its still ok.  I do find that these get slippery faster than the tortex materials if my hands sweat at all.  Ive been subjective in my comparisons -- but this is what Ive found so far.  I find that they stand out sound wise for the guitars Im currently playing.  The process of finding the right pick is never ending and changes over time.  Give these a try and let me know what you think.,Very good sound with these picks -- worth a try,1332028800,03 18 2012,Good

I feel like I am playing with a nickle. I like the indentation. Helps the grip a lot. I should have paid more attention to the size and thickness. Still looking for the right picks for me.

A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B0002D0CKI,Frederick Baptist,The thing about picks or plectrums if you prefer is that they are really a matter of preference and once you pick one (no pun intended) you should try to stick to it and get used to it through practice.  Ive used many different types of picks over the years and Ive not found the ideal one for me until recently when I decided to use a SilverPick which is basically a standard triangle thin design but made of silver which I find fits my needs the best and so far its just a case of getting used to it.  This particular Dunlop pick is as described being fat stubby and sturdy with a nice grippable centre and if you are the kind of lead guitarist who uses a lot of pinch harmonics this pick will be good for you as the maximum grip and most comfortable holding position exposes very little of the pick face.  The hardness will make it good for fast playing but the thickness also makes it difficult to get a firm grip too and the very small size makes it easy to lose your grip if you hit the strings too hard.  This makes it unfit for bass players and for strumming although you could get used to this for lead guitar playing.  For me though Ill keep this among my collection of picks for use but its not my default or preferred choice for play.,Small Hard Good for Lead Guitarists Only!,1230940800,01 3 2009,Average

A1IB42LRNA9QLW,B0002D0CKI,Joshua Cuellar FurianGuitarist,When I first got them I thought that they were going to be cheap as they felt extremely light and came in the cheap packaging but it was ok I wasnt expecting much from them. The picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material. They did not bend at all when I tried to (and believe me I tried). Pick wearing is virtually non-existent and I utilize Alt-Picking a lot in my practices. I actually learned my first sweep shred (D major) with these picks within a day of getting them.I highly recommend for the shred guitarist.My only complaint is that pinch harmonics are kind of hard to do (becuase of the grip) but i got used to it rather quickly.IMPORTANT!!!You can get these in 24 packs at [...] for only $10!!!

They wear down fast.  Mine are usually worn out after a day of use and I dont think I play particularly hard.

After hearing him play with these picks Ive noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these. The finger grips help tremendously and these have really helped to bring his playing to the next level. My only complaint is that they sent us a pack of purple picks.

A2Z89YMZZJWBHS,B0002D0CKI,Sunn Kram,Ive been using these 2.0s as my primary pick for years now and I love them. The way the material surrounds your finger tips is unique and not found in a flat pick. Theyre very easy to keep a grip on and allow you to go after the strings confidently.You will however find that there is a sweet spot in the life of the picks tip. When you first use them the business end is extremely pointy sharp almost. After playing a bit the tip begins to round off and is perfect for a long time. Eventually it really rounds out and youll want a fresh one. I typically lose them before they wear out and they are so nice you wont care.,My Long Time Favorite,1319068800,10 20 2011,Good
A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0002D0CKI,trebe,How a guitar pick feels is such a matter of individual preference that there really doesnt seem to be much point in trying to rate them as what I like about a particular type of pick may not be relevant to another player.  Most picks have high ratings because players who like that particular type write reviews that rate them highly.  Obviously the best thing to do is playing with a pick on your own guitar but that isnt always possible.  With that said for what they are worth here are my thoughts regarding Jim Dunlops purple colored Big Stubby 3.0mm picks.I like a pick with a sharp point for better control and the Big stubby certainly meets that criteria.  The sharp point and the picks rounded edges help the Stubby to slide smoothly off of the individual strings which makes for easier picking.  Besides electric guitar I find these picks nicely suited for acoustic and semi-solid body guitars where the string tension is greater.I had tried the 1.0mm Stubby previously but the 3.0mm pick is much thicker and heavier and has absolutely no give at all.  Im still getting used to playing with something this stiff and hard.  Although the pick has rounded depressions on each side for the fingers when picking rapidly I find that maintaining grip can still be a little tricky.  Keeping the pick clean and dry does help.My favorite pick had been theDunlop 0.6mm nylon pick but I am very pleased with the performance and feel of the 3.0mm Stubby.  I can locate the strings easily and be more precise while still being able to play with decent speed.  Time will tell but this may become my new favorite pick.The pick pack contains 24 picks.  I only paid $2.99 which is simply an outstanding deal.  If youre a player looking for a really stiff almost indestructible pick you might want to give this ultra heavy duty Stubby a try.,this pick helped to improve the precision of my playing...,1377302400,08 24 2013,Best
A18RGYRCEN181M,B0002D0CKI,Truvor,Using the stubby spoiled me for all other picks. You simply play faster no matter what level you are. Alternate picking speeds increase because there is no more flat-pick drag. Now I only use flat picks for acoustic play when I want to hear the crunch. 24 picks in a pack is an insane bargain.

For some reason i decided to pick it back up and after a few minutes i came to like the pick. Days after using it i got accustomed to its size and I became much more efficient with picking. And I no longer had to worry about the pick slipping. I cant really go back to normal sized picks now.. haha. Thats like the only downside I can think of.

A1IQKXGJSKTAHP,B0002D0CLC,Slick Rhoads,I bought these and used them for a week before giving my review.If Amazon used half-stars I would have given them 3.5/5. I just couldnt bring myself to give them a 4/5 so I went with 3/5 heres why:Ive used standard medium picks for over 20 years. Switching to these was not a problem at all. Sure they are smaller but not small enough to cause me any problems. By far the biggest change was the &#34;pointy-ness&#34; of the picks. The distinct point on the pick drastically changes the sound of your playing especially when playing chords. Everything is much more pronounced which isnt necessarily a good thing in my opinion. Its especially bad when playing clean electric (picking notes or strumming).If someone was to ask me if these are good picks my answer would be &#34;it depends.&#34; It really does in my opinion it depends on what youre playing. From a rhythm standpoint I dont like these at all - they take the warmth out of the chords because the point of the pick makes strummed chords sound too sterile to me. For lead work they are OK because you can really dig into each note and have it come through.Could I play faster with them? No. Could I pull off amazing licks that I couldnt do with my normal picks? No.I tried them but didnt like them. Maybe if you typically play a TON of lead work constantly these would be the way to go. I dont and they arent for me. Im glad I tried them though because Ill never wonder again if they were for me.,Depends on what youre playing,1391299200,02 2 2014,Average

AXXYMIJBD0J9G,B0002D0COE,Chuck,Its nothing special.  No frills just a simple concept that works.  Its important to maintain humidity in your instrument especially in a dry climate like west Texas.  The evaporation rate will depend on the amount of humidity in the air where you store your instrument.So when you first start using it you have to be diligent to check the sponge regularly to ensure that it is still moist.,Nothing Special,1369008000,05 20 2013,Average

A1VFUMY02HJIFY,B0002D0COE,D. Dreifus,Purchased this to replace the Dampit as a no drip alternative. With the solid base it will not drip and it fairly easy to use. Distilled water will extend the life of the sponge. Overall simple and effective.However I may have added too much humidity. Was using in conjunction with humidipak to keep them from drying out thinking they would absorb any excess humidity but I then noticed an irregularity in the reflection of the pick guard and the tone seemed to be muted so shifted over to humidipak only and will re humidify them outside the guitar case.I do use a hydrometer but I dont think it was effectively reading the inside of the guitar but only the inside of the case.So I think the Planet Waves humidifier works well for its intended purpose but you do have to monitor that you are not over or under utilizing it.,No drip humidifier,1385337600,11 25 2013,Best
AOGJD9K1UN63X,B0002D0COE,G. L. Simms,I have an electronic indoor/outdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifier.It is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometer.The whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47%.This makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier. Makes the whole house safer for the Martins.Now you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity but I think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor system.A sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too. Just dont get water on the wood.And dont forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case. Many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the case.All the better acoustic guitar shops I go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms.,OK?,1388102400,12 27 2013,Average
A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ,B0002D0COE,Guitar Operator Guitar Operator,I thought I would throw my two-cents in about the new design and effectiveness of this soundhole humidifier.After making a few homemade case humidifiers out of things like a travel butter container with many holes drilled into it and a sponge I started thinking about how some of the cases separate the body cavity from the neck & headstock cavity inside the guitar case and not allowing the humidity to flow freely to all areas especially the body where it is needed the most.Even though I was getting acceptable humidification in the case I was concerned about the body being dryer in comparison so I went ahead and splurged the 8 bucks on these. (I actually bought three of them.)I crank the gas heat up in the house in the winter and A/C in the summer keep my guitars inside their cases and inside a closet. The humidity drops quite low but the sponges remain moist for several days before I can no longer fight the urge to re-wet them. lol.Two great tips in one:Use a regular more dense sponge thicker like the ones at the dollar store. Cut them to size and stuff them in!Throw away the sponge when it starts to get yucky and dont worry about distilled water unless you want to. I cant argue using very pure water compared to the possibly toxic crap that comes out our faucets but for one dollar you can get a boat load of them after you cut them to size and toss them away without any regard when needing replaced.Dont worry about the &#34;thing&#34; hanging in-between your strings. It will not damage anything unless you get the sponge  too saturated and it leaks. I will either squeeze the excess water out or shake the container with the sponge inside until I am satisfied that it wont drip.The humidifier will not cause any stress or damage to your strings by spreading them when you wedge this inside your soundhole.If you ARE rough careless thoughtless or stupid you could possibly knock this loose and have it rub or fall out but I would be more worried about the guitar and what it would take for this to happen. This would be more extreme to the guitar than the humidifier or any harm it could cause.The top snaps on by squeezing the sides to release little tabs that stick through the top cover. The sponge inside is quite small and there isnt too much room for a much larger sponge. The device is simple and fairly solid. Treat it gently and it will last forever. You can easily clean the inside or run it through a dishwasher. If you give the inside a quick rinse every few fills Im sure it would be a decade before anything &#34;built up&#34; to require extensive cleaning or replacement.Keep an eye on it for the first few days and then weeks to get a feel for when you should be re-wetting the sponge.Try to keep the sponge moist when its dry.I strongly suggest getting an Oasis case humidifier (or similar) mini sized about 1&#34; X 4&#34; costing around 17-20 bucks.This will take any guesswork out of the equation and give you fairly accurate readings inside your guitar or instrument case.Remember too much humidity can cause your acoustic guitar to warp. Too dry and it will shrink and crack split the soundboard (top) also leaving the edges of the frets sticking out like the backbone of a fish and quite abrasive!If you spent more than one hundred dollars on your guitar and live where it gets cold and/or dry you would be negligent (if not careless) to spend the pittance to make sure your baby aint thirsty or worse...dead & broken!Hope this helps!,Works Fine & Much Better Than Nothing!,1390262400,01 21 2014,Good

A3HN470MGR70D2,B0002D0COE,JMAC JMAC,This is a simple humidifier for guitars with a round sound hole.  It would not work for an f-hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele.  Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge.  If you use distilled water (as recommended) it should last quite a while.  The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides.  The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly.  Dont push it all the way in after moistening and you wont have a problem.  I drip a little distilled water on the sponge squeeze out any excess and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings suspended in the middle of the sound hole.  They cant be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings.  Ive never had one of these move from where I left it.If the sponge isnt dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case.  When the humidity is very low (30% or less) the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case isnt opened.  As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days.If you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar (or dont want to see one) use a guitar humidifier!  Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels (between 45% and 60% is ideal for most guitars).  Air conditioning can do the same.  For especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar(s) is okay.  For many reasons its always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use.  A humidifier is inexpensive extra precaution at those times of year when temperature or humidity changes quickly.,A Good Basic Humidifier for Round Hole Acoustic Guitars,1295913600,01 25 2011,Good
A3QNHDUBMA6WQM,B0002D0COE,John G.,I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy except distilled water.  In all actuality its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry youll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  id rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets hydrated? I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills so its not that much of a hassle.Overall good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J,The only refill you need is distilled water....Im in.,1393891200,03 4 2014,Best

A5MC7LP0ZBO4Q,B0002D0COE,Lets.Be.Reasonable.,Works for me. But It splits the two middle strings way more than my peace of mind allows me to be comfortable with it. They made it thinner so it doesnt stretch the strings too much & as a consequence it will only fit a thin sponge which dries easy as far as Arizona & California is concerned.Suggestion to Planet Waves: I think you can make it thicker but instead of splitting the strings redesign the mount say with a Velcro so that its still hangs on the sound hall but its attached to the strings. Its possible to attach your product in a different way because Ive modified mine & to my personal preference works without splitting the screen.,As advertised.,1396224000,03 31 2014,Good

A1WQNVR4H66YX9,B0002D0CQC,D. Gray yargnad,I am in agreement with others that state this is a must-have. I battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard. This really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood. Ive used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard. I rub the entire neck down before and after I play. It makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop which I suspect is what they mustve been using all these years and never told me though I never did ask...foolish me.

A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B0002D0CQC,Frederick Baptist,I discovered this string lubricant many years ago and I concur with what most of the reviewers here have said about it although I wouldnt call it a string cleaner although you indirectly clean the strings if you use the cloth and like another reviewer stated you should also use the cloth to clean the undersides of your strings as well.  I unfortunately live in a very humid climate being only a little above the equator and so strings have a very short life here and so anything that can prolong their life is a real boon for a musician here.  I agree that the only downside is the inability to tell in advance that you are running low on lubricant until it actually turns dry but I guess given the price and the overall usefulness of this accessory one cannot complain too much.  Now that mine has just run dry Im going to delay a replacement purchase while I try out something new that Ive just discovered called The Swipe which enables me to clean both the undersides and the topsides of my strings without chemicals.  If this works as well as advertised I may still get Fast-Fret but for its lubricating properties which really helps make playing a lot more comfortable.Recommended!,Very Useful Accessory For String Instrumentalists!,1229644800,12 19 2008,Good

A1GM034H7XPDEW,B0002D0CQC,Hurley I thought I was wrong once but I was ...,Especially for the price this is a great buy.  The strings on my acoustic were starting to get a bit loud when I would slide up and down the fretboard and I was noticing quite a bit of lag when sliding too.  The only downside is that it would be much easier to apply this directly to the frets without the strings on but the appeal is to bring life back to strings that arent shining like they use to.  I just had to take a little extra time and care to get as much oil onto the fretboard and then make sure I wiped it in/off as thoroughly as possible which required folding the provided rag and inserting it between the strings and fretboard and taking my time as I went from fret to fret.  Not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing.  The ease of sliding was tremendously improved and the strings sound and feel better than ever!

A1LZ7QGWHBHWOD,B0002D0CQC,Peter Kim,This makes sliding on the bass real smooth. Its also nice for cleaning. It is hard to tell if you are running low on oil or whatever liquid is in this thing but they seem to last for a fairly long time. And its super easy to apply.

I tried my best to get use to this product but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty.

AKYDGCKCY7H9F,B0002D0CQC,R. W. Milyard GearJunky,I agree with all of the reviews but have found another area to use fast fret on: THE NUT. When tuning the strings (especially the lower wound strings) hang up on the nut which causes the string to pop instead of slide as it would on a roller nut. Dab Fast Fret onto the nut before tuning and this problem is greatly reduced.,Another use,1209513600,04 30 2008,Best
A23AKO4BZLZ8DE,B0002D0CQC,stefanj,I got this product to clean and condition my guitar fretboards (well duh!)  Does it work?  Yes and no.  First it did not appear that anything was coming out.  After a bit of rubbing I did notice a &#34;slight&#34; bit of solution (turns out its mineral oil)on the fretboard by the frets.  I tried to spread it out with the included cloth and discovered that the cloth was useless (a paper towel would hold up better- seriously!)  I used an old tee shirt square and spread some of the oil around- but honestly it took me 10 to 15 mins and I noticed NO difference in the appearence or the playability of the guitar.  It says to use it before and after each session- thats about 30 mins of my time per guitar (I general play 2 guitars durning the course of a session).  I do still use this occasionally but I would not spend money to purchase it again.  Just not what I was looking for in a fret board cleaner.,meh.,1393372800,02 26 2014,Average
A2MIP3AQVSF2SS,B0002D0CQC,Teh Arbitrageur PM,Lets cut to the chase: this is more or less a tight roll of gauze soaked in mineral oil.

A2C46HQIZLYJUC,B0002D0CQC,tj,I used this on a 5string bass. I liked how this helps me slide around the fretboard easier. My friend tried it on her acoustic guitar and hated it.Her reason for her opinion is simple. This stuff puts out a LOT more oil (or whatever it is) than you would think. This has the unintended consequence of the oil making your hard-earned callouses soft...which when playing guitar can lead to bleeding fingers pretty fast (and did for my friend).To apply this you simply hold the handle and press down while running it along each string one string at a time. I highly suggest you only use one slide down each string. At first it may not look like anything is getting on your strings but give it a few minutes and you will start to see the excess oil appear and start pooling under the strings on your fretboard. Thats ok. You will need to wipe away the excess and Im telling you if you accidentally get too much that excess oil may not come off easily (didnt for me at least). Mine left little pools of oil between the frets and I only used one swipe and thought I had just a little on there. Naturally this product also makes your fingers very oily feeling. My friend hated that part too and I agree with her. Soft callouses = no callouses. This is a good product idea and I like it in theory and with my thick bass strings I didnt have the severe problem w soft fingertips that she did. Just be aware of the possibility of that being a problem for you.It does what it says but you may not like what else it does or how it feels on your fingers.,Good product idea could causes problems for some people.,1329782400,02 21 2012,Average

A27PF2GVKMJSAA,B0002D0CQC,ultravega,The tips of my fingers often get pretty dry and cracked especially when Ive been playing a lot.  The problem at least for me is that pieces of the dead skins sometimes catch on guitar strings making slides bends and pull-offs less fluid.  A few strokes of GHS makes the fretboard give me a much smoother playing experience.  An alternative would be using Vaseline on my fingers but that would probably be terrible for my fretboard.  Also I sometimes use an Emory board to smooth my fingertips which helps but Id rather do that as little as possible to keep callouses strong.  GHS allows me to minimize that.,Use this to shread great for cracked/dry finger tips,1367884800,05 7 2013,Best

They are still going strong.,A Great Low-Cost Mic,1380672000,10 2 2013,Good
A2F92AOWTIUIB,B0002D0HY4,StudioDude,This microphone is the best microphone I have ever owned. It is very dense a little quiet but the sound is absolutely brilliant quality. It is very clear sounding and very well built. Get this mic. You will not regret it.,This microphone Rocks!,1365379200,04 8 2013,Best
A157DYI1PMXDR1,B0002D0HY4,thrashreno,I like the durability of it and the on/off switch. it came with a carrying bag and a mic holder + adapter. its not as powerful and clear as i though it would be but its far better than the other mics in the price range that i have used. i havent tried this through a PA live yet. i just bought an Helicon voicetone and im hoping it boosts it a little. im sure i will have this mic for years to come and hopefully i can spring for a better Shure later on.,Much Better than my old mic,1394841600,03 15 2014,Good
A10ZSXTQA264C7,B0002D0JZ6,Bubb Rubb,Holy guacamole you guys- this amp...I was terrified at first because I plugged in and turned on and had NO SOUND.Took the batteries out and fumed over my foolish purchase then decided to try once more.Fired it up with my electric kazoo plugged in and WE HAVE LIFT OFF!So rocking.I actually got this for my acoustic-electric ukulele and it sounds beautiful through it. I keep the volume low and the door open about 1&#34; to get a clean-ish tone. Havent cranked it up yet for that dirty blues sound but Im sure itll sound awesome too.,Its so funky I can smell it!!,1390953600,01 29 2014,Best
A15TYOEWBQYF0X,B0002D0JZ6,David W Dave,First I have to say the only reason I bought this is that we have two pot belly pigs that live in our house...so this was a no-brainer to purchase just to have as a fan of pigs and I play the guitar too.Now for the review.This little &#34;collector&#34; amp turns out to be something I will actually use rather than put on a shelf to look at with all of our other pig stuff.I was very surprised how well built it is.  Its solid as a rock with chrome handles edge guards and a pig snout for the volume control.It looks like a mini suit case and contrary to another review the AC adapter fits into a compartment inside so it may be stored internally.  It also operates on batteries which makes this little thing quite the gem to take with us this summer.  Now I can take the Fender or Gibson electrics rather than the acoustic.Okay I keep getting off topic here...The sound is clear and crisp for its size.  Sure its not my Fender Mustang IV but I didnt pay 600 bucks for it either.  But then my Fender doesnt have a pigs snout!!  There are no controls on this for tone adjustments just a volume knob.  But most of our modern electric guitars have quite a bit of tone adjustment anyway.  I would compare the sound coming from it as above average but its the novelty of the amp that is the real attraction for me anyway.As for its size I would say its just about the size of your average small jewelry box.  But its much heavier deceptively heavy but I like that.  It doesnt have that &#34;cheap&#34; feel about it.Like I said I WILL use this occasionally especially during summer months when we cruise in the convertible or in the conversion van.  I look forward to the comments the amp will get Im sure way more than my guitar playing skills as I still have a lot to learn.  But learning should be fun and this little amp and is just another way to make it even more fun.In summary I would highly recommend this to any pig lover who owns a guitar or to anyone whos looking for a portable amp that operates on either batteries or an AC adapter.A word to best describe it....&#34;COOL&#34;.,WAY better louder and clearer than I ever expected  AND IT IS SO CUTE!!!,1390348800,01 22 2014,Best
ACWJDL1ZYX8RE,B0002D0JZ6,Dr. Dale,I have had this amp for quite some time and find that it does exactly what I want it to!  It is so much easier to carry around and needs no outlet.  Turn in half way up you get a clean sound...crank it maxed and you get that distortion that made it so famous.  I own a piece of the legend and music history!,This Piggy Is Legendary!,1361664000,02 24 2013,Best
A3AOPVQ7EZHTWA,B0002D0JZ6,frankp93 frankp93,Put away your effects pedals modellers and software for awhile and get back to the earth - or at least the simple appreciation of what an electric guitar sound can be straight off the axe with nothing but pickups volume and tone pots to shape it.For me the classic Pignose-and-a-Strat sound is the opening of I Looked Away from Layla but Im sure everyones got their favorites.Loud enough to feel the air and coax a variety of natural-sounding distorted tones. Stick an SM-57 in front of it and fool a lot of people into thinking its a tube amp. By working your guitar knobs you can get a clean sound along with that barely breaking up holy grail of tone for many blues and rock players.By learning how much you can do with relatively little youll gain a new appreciation of the strengths and weaknesses of all the tone-shaping tools that have come along since.It might surprise those who take todays hyper-saturated over-processed metal distortion for granted as the official community-sanctioned guitar tone to discover the challenges and pleasure of touch and response with subtle dynamics and without infinite sustain.One bit of weirdness: When I began playing my Pignose I immediately noticed a buzz as though something small was rattling around between the speaker cone and front grill. The four mounting nuts were easy to loosen and sure enough an extra washer had gotten caught in there during assembly. Fortunately it slid right out and there was no damage.Get the power adapter and save the batteries for when you absolutely have no choice.The first amp I ever had was a small Ampeg tube from the early 60s with a single 6 inch speaker volume and tone knobs. Ive no idea how many watts it put out - not enough for my parents to complain from their bedroom next door. With that baby cranked I spent many happy hours in tone heaven. All these years (and amps) later I guess Ive always been searching for that sound and the Pignose comes closer than any tube distortion blues overdrive pedal or rat-ty box Ive tried.For the money you cant beat it.,Thoreau Would Love It,1357344000,01 5 2013,Best
A3USVXMH3QNRLG,B0002D0JZ6,Ken Yo,Fantastic. Just love this little amp.At first thought it was broken but batteries were  not sitting in right.Very happy its ok.,Love the sound,1400544000,05 20 2014,Best
AG5L0MYSPPWDC,B0002D0JZ6,Mano,Sounds simply great!  As greasy as a Pignose has to groan and as simple as it has to be.  Great on bass notes and can also get clean with highs; it does sound different when opened and by moving the guitar volume it changes its distortion (the louder the more distorted).  The Pignose power supply (Pignose AC9 Power Supply for Pignose 7100) is helpful when been home but also works with 6 AA batteries.  You can also amplify its sound by connecting it to a higher-watt amp.  It comes with really nice looking stickers.  Im planning to keep it for years.Update on review(Jan 9 2013).I admit that it might be more expensive that other 5 watt amps but as time goes by I just fall more in love with my Piggy!  Ive learned to use better its own volume combined with the guitars.I have other amps of higher power that can get a LOT louder that the Pignose but I just LOVE the level of distortion it gives; I cannot get this crunch with the other amps no matter how much pedals bells whistles I have tried... This crunch is unique and the world loves it as simple and plain as that.  The good thing is that it has an output at the back to connect it to louder amps and like that you can have at louder volumes that unique crunch I so much fell in love with.The 7 chords give a clean amazing sweet-grumble (the one that make teenage girls sigh for you...) with high volume on the Piggy and low on the guitar.,Muddy Pig,1320278400,11 3 2011,Best
A2IPU94WKACV06,B0002D0JZ6,Mark,I didnt know a little battery powered amp could sound so good.  It sounds just as good if not better than my Roland Cube 20 of course without the effects and such but still a great little amp for practice and a little gig with family and friends.  Puts out pretty good power for a little 5w.  Has a great sound in my opinion.,I was skeptical at first,1376870400,08 19 2013,Best
A1RPTVW5VEOSI,B0002D0JZ6,Michael J. Edelman,The Pignose is not the worlds best travel amp or portable amp or practice amp. Its not very good for vocals its inefficient what with its 40-year old design and it distorts way too easy. There are far better amps for most purposes from Boss and others that deliver a lot more clean volume thanks to modern class-D amp technology and a variety of digital effects to boot.BUT... there is one area where the Pig prevails. If youre looking for the sound of a big overdriven amp in the studio or miked on stage the Pignose will give you that sound for less than the cost of one good quality overdrive pedal. By opening and closing the box you can get a range of cabinet sounds from the open-back Fender to the classic Marchall sealed cab and everything in between. Frank Zappa recorded a lot of his guitar parts using nothing but his SG running into a Pignose and he got fantastic sounds.Beyond that its cool looking reasonably rugged and even has pegs that allow you to hang it from a guitar strap. Every rocker needs one.,A classic,1337990400,05 26 2012,Best
A27AD1FFGBVFY0,B0002D0JZ6,RobE,The previous reviews are pretty accurate though I would add that when the Pignose cabinet is closed it can often sound rather boxy. It sounded much clearer and cleaner when it was opened a couple of inches.As for using pedals with it it will take distortion to a degree. It reaches a point if pushed too hard at which the definition of the distortion will begin turning mushy and shrill. You can use a distortion + overdrive to decent effect especially if you are running a cleaner sounding OD like a Tube Screamer. I dont think it would do so well with a Bad Monkey for example though which has more dirt in the tones it produces. I dont have a fuzz box (not yet but have one on order) but I think most fuzzes will sound like crap unless you use a relatively cleaner sweeter one like the Red Witch Fuzz God or the Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz. Otherwise you will hear too much ground asphalt in the sound.My wah wah a Morley Power Wah was almost useless with it. The limited frequency response of the 5 speaker made it sound overly throaty on cleans and when I put the boost in the shrillness would show itself again.A chorus pedal sounds totally sweet on it but a phaser in my case a Phase 90 just destroys the sound. A flanger is also not really advisable. You can use delay just not with very rapid repeats. Putting a compressor in front of your clean signal would probably make it more manageable for the Pignose speaker. I just bought a Dynacomp but havent tried it on the piggy.This is a good cheap first amp to buy for a youngster who is just beginning their journey on guitar and for practice when you are on the road on vacation or business. Once the young un seems dedicated though it is time to think about moving up to a VOX AC15C1 (note: that amp can do hard rock fine but not high gain metal) or an ENGL Screamer. I personally cant imagine recording with it but Y guess that would depend on the engineering skills available to you.,Using Pedals With it is a Mixed Bag,1309219200,06 28 2011,Average
A2LSR40ZH18TPH,B0002D0KOG,Amazon Customer,Using this to mic my Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet. It is holding a Shure SM57 microphone.

A34WEXT7SIRFE4,B0002D0KOG,@ciscoza,I just purchased the mic stand for my desk at home. It does the job well. If youre looking to do some desktop podcasting or internet radio then its perfect. Many adjustments to get just the right position. Its definitely not a performance mic as it does feel a bit filmsy but you wont notice the flimsiness except for when youre adjusting it. Adjusting it is a tad tedious but you can get a really good position with the microphone after a couple minutes.Ive mounted my Samson Q1U Dynamic Cardioid USB microphone to it. It works well for sure. Then I attached the standard pop filter and the microphone started tipping it over. Make sure the boom is aligned with a leg extension or it will tip over if theres too much weight. Just find something semi heavy and find a way to attached it to the existing counter-weight and it will be excellent. So this mic wont play nice with your large condensers + pop filters + shockmount at the start but just find a good counter weight and all will be well.It looks great and will definitely be easy on the eyes in any room. It was a good investment and all in all you definitely get what you pay for. If youre hesitant on attaching a lot of stuff to it then I would recommend shelling out a couple more dollars for a sturdier stand.But atleast for me it does the job and does it well.,Great stand but the the counter-weight could be heavier.,1291161600,12 1 2010,Good
A33F2WVDF74EA7,B0002D0KOG,F. L. Hall Methuselah,This little fellow is well built out of mostly steel and is heavy for its size. The locking knobs do their job without fail and I dont have to over crank them to get them to hold. I use it sitting on top of my table which holds my computer recording interface and all the other stuff I use for recording. It adjust perfect for vocals and I drop it down if I want to use it for recording my acoustic guitars without using a pickup. Same with my violins. I get a different sound recording through a mic than I do a pickup.The base is heavy and will hold a mic with the boom extended all the way. You must turn one foot in the direction of use to get a full extension but with a minute retraction it will stand securely in any direction. I set it where I want it then just swing it out of the way till I need it. I have used it sitting on the floor by my chair and reaches fine for vocals or acoustics. Its just more accessible on the desk. This would work fine for drummers.I would recommend this to any of my critical buddies. Thanks,Sampson MB1 Mini Boom Stand,1395878400,03 27 2014,Best
A1E5FQZTUM8OC1,B0002D0KOG,Kenwood,This mic stand will work great for micing full stacks and guitar amps.Some people have mentioned the counterweight could be heavier but they need to pay attention to how they are orienting the feet in relation to the microphone. You should make sure one of the feet is pointing in the exact same direction as the microphone arm so that way the downward force is applied directly onto the support leg.,Great Stand,1375920000,08 8 2013,Best
A14PY68SX7D5DV,B0002D0KOG,Leonardo Lee,Just got this stand today.First impressions are always important and this stand gave me a good impression.It seems to be made solid enough not like some cheap off brand crap.The base is solid and heavy to keep the stand from falling over.The telescope mechanism is quite well made.Comes with a cable clip and an adjustment piece for smaller mic adapters.I got mine set up to extend up to 3ft tall. Its quite the perfect height for when Im seated on my stool.One thing I did not quite like about the construction is the crew on rod to the base place. It unscrews easily when the mic stand is moved. Maybe adding something to keep it screwed in?Would recommend to others.Probably will be buying a few more to mic my amps and cabs.,good buy for the buck,1336003200,05 3 2012,Good

A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y,B0002D0KOG,Mike Tarrani Jazz Drummer,I use this with fairly light mics (seeNady DMK-5 Drum Mic Packagefor details).While I generally do not mic bass drums when I do this stand allows me to do it my way which may seem unconventional to some folks. I place the mic on the batter side of the drum about three feet back. Since this can be problematic with the floor tom and throne (and hi-hat) hindering access the boom and adjustability of this stand are a great help.Where the stand shines if micing amps. Some small amps such as theFender Champion 600 Electric Guitar Amplifierare usually placed on a raised surface to keep them off the floor. This stand will reach any stand that is chair seat height. For larger amps that are on the floor or tiltback stands this mic stand will still allow you to position the mic where you need it.My use is relatively narrow - kick drums and amps. But for each this stand is excellent in my opinion. With the mics I am using it is heavy enough to remain stable and for where I need to place those mics it allows me to do so with relative ease.,Perfect for bass drums and amps,1337731200,05 23 2012,Best

It leaves a protective coating on the guitar which not only protects the finish it also makes it ultra-shiny glossy and brings out the rich deep colors. This is fantastic stuff. If you own a guitar this is the best product out there. But what else can you expect from a US company like Gibson. I was very suprised that it was this effective. This little bottle goes a long way. I have already polished all of my guitars and my friends guitars and I still have more than 1/2 a bottle left. If you need to polish your guitar look no further. This is your best choice.,OMG!!!

A16UCWYG4924HH,B0002D0MFI,Kenneth G. Nielsen Kenneth,The cloth that comes with the product is a high quality polishing cloth but some idiot thought it was best to package it stuck to the bottle with a glue button that leaves glue stuck to the cloth. This glue is only removable after a expensive bath using Goo Gone or similar glue dissolving solution then washing with warm soapy water by hand and rinsing thoroughly in clear clean running water until all soap is removed then hanging the cloth up to air dry preferably outdoors in the sunshine if you have that available. The cloth is so nice it is worth the time-consuming and correct method of cleaning but is not why you buy a product that is supposed to clean and polish in the first place. Somebody better redesign the packaging for this product as the Gibson cleaner polish is first-rate and puts a high lustrous shine on the guitar surface which comes out bright dry and hard almost like having used a high quality paste wax but without residue. Very good stuff very irresponsible packaging for the convenience of the factory I assume but without forethought to the customers needs.,The polish is great the packaging sucks.,1398211200,04 23 2014,Best

AKSFZ4G1AXYFC,B0002D0N70,C.E. Frank,This is my second condenser microphone and I have to say that I love it. I previously owned an Audio Technica 2020 condenser mic which sounded thin and not as natural to me. I noticed that this mic does not really boost any frequencies like some other mics do in this price range. With this microphone what you hear with your ears is basically what you get. Of course room acoustics and microphone positioning all play a large part in the final sound.I use an Alesis mic preamp with a Focusrite 2i2 interface and the recordings sound clean. Another thing to mention this is a variable pattern condenser mic. However even with all the polar patterns that this mic has to offer I usually just leave it on cardioid since I mainly use the M179 for vocals. Although I usually only record vocals I also record electric guitar acoustic guitar and drums with the same microphone.Overall my experience with this microphone has been pretty great. I think that for this price it will be hard to find another microphone that can perform on the same level.,A work horse with transparent sound!,1368835200,05 18 2013,Best
A1L7M2JXN4EZCR,B0002D0N70,David G,I sent it back probably due to my ignorance.  Has multiple patterns to collect sound.  Was a clear mike but I didnt detect any body to the sound.  Maybe a preamp would have helped.  I checked out many mikes and ended up with a Rode NT-1A which is probably similar in character.  My goal was to record my voice without color and this came close.  I wonder how this could have a zillion ratings of five stars?  Suspicious ratings to me.  Now that I have more experience I would be curious to check it out.  But since I found a good solution I dont think its worth the effort.,Clear mike (my own spelling of microphone),1396828800,04 7 2014,Good
A2W8RH6YUNXH83,B0002D0N70,HoboKing67,Ok heres the deal...Im just a small home studio type of guy and honestly I wasnt expecting much when I shelled out the $120 for this mic.  I have just always seen it around and I thought it would be a solid choice for my first multi-pattern mic!  The first time I recorded with it I had it on omni mode and played some acoustic....it sounded amazing!  I cant believe this mic is that good.  Crisp clean sound (who cares if its made in China like that one guy says?) and very flexible usage.  Ive since used it on toms acoustic a room mic for amps and even some background vocals and it has shined every time!So if youre like me and looking for a low-price LDC with multiple patterns GET THIS.

A164BJ2NU1NSJZ,B0002D0N70,Michael A. Johnson,this mic gives a great range of recording purposes! Seems well built and rugged the only complaint I have is that the face plate on the front fell off after only a month of light use they must use a cheap adhesive for it I had to clean both surfaces and give it a dab of gorilla glue to get the plate back on,great audio quality but the front plate fell off after a month,1398470400,04 26 2014,Good
AW91VDERXXKGT,B0002D0N70,Nessander,I bought this mic after hearing good things about it but I had never tried it. It has impressed me quite a bit since then. I use it in a small home studio set-up along with a Presonus Firebox and Logic Pro on a Macbook.For the price this mic is a very good deal. It sounds much better than an Audio Technica 3035 that I had (and ended up selling shortly after getting this mic). I also got an Oktava MK-319 that is a much more expensive mic and that was then sent to be moded by Michael Joly (and therefore cost even more) and Id say the two mics are very similar. I end up using the CAD M179 a lot more because its less valuable but sounds just as good.What else? It has low noise and combines the crispness you want from a condenser without being unpleasant. It sounds particularly great for male vocals in my opinion although I have used it for as a room drum-mic. I would highly recommend this mic especially at this price point.,Excellent mic for the price -- esp. for vocals,1239840000,04 16 2009,Best

This microphone has very very low self noise low distortion and a continuously adjustable variable pattern.Ive listened to and recorded with this mic and compared it to many other high priced options. This mic is outstanding the sound of the mic simply disappears  . . . it records just about anything presented to it very naturally with great detail but without hype or over brightness.I applaud CAD for keeping the price low which provides a great mic for drum mixing which would not be possible at the price point of this  more expensive functional competition.,Variable pattern low noise,1328400000,02 5 2012,Best

A22Z554ZQ8NFPC,B0002D0Q2W,AF Whigs,I owned a Boss graphic eq many years ago and never really took to it.  Ah the folly of youth.  First this pedal is dirt cheap but the build quality actually seems very solid. The sliders have a nice feel to them as does the on/off switch.  If you have any tonal issues with your amp then a graphic eq is an easy solution. No it wont make you love an amp you hate but if youre ALMOST THERE or even just want to add some sonic variety you wont really realize how useful and vital a graphic eq is.My rig right now is a strat and jazzmaster into a Pro Jr.  I love the amp but as the volume goes up the treble gets a bit piercing.  Ive been able to tame that issue with this pedal.  Its a subtle thing. It takes some time to play around with the sliders and figure out what will really hit your amps sweet spot - at least in my application where Im leaving it on all the time.  This pedal would also be good for a solo boost as it has plenty of output to make your leads punch through.Overall for this price you cant go wrong.  This is one of those pedals that has a million applications and will always have a use in my setup.  Im thinking of getting a second one and building a pedalboard specific to my acoustic rig (comp eq chorus reverb).,You dont realize how much you need this pedal,1298592000,02 25 2011,Best
A1CD7IUM2JRPY1,B0002D0Q2W,Alexander V. Ramos Doc Taz,Seriously this is a great pedal. I cant improve upon what others have said but I will mention a few points.1. I use this after the preamp or dirt boxes for a lead tone or to add more crunch to my Fender Frontman 212 when inserted in the effects loop. Its run before time based effects (delay phaser etc) for me.2. I sometimes use it before the distortion as a clean booster while focusing one of the sliders to boost a few frequencies.3. If it gets noisy or self oscillates after a while change the battery to a fresh one. Better yet use an AC adapter.I found out about the last issue after reading a few Harmony Central reviews. Otherwise its been on my setup for about seven years. I take care of my stuff.,Tastier than Fish N Chips,1266537600,02 19 2010,Good

Ive been thinking on using it mainly as a boost for leads but it sounds so much better with it i cant seem to turn it off!its light small and it looks well built but only time will tell how resistent it is but hey for 30 bucks its a great deal!This is a good EQ for an excelent price not an excelent EQ so i give it a 4 out of 5 and look forward to testing some others danelectro pedals.,a very nice EQ,1336953600,05 14 2012,Good

A110ZEDSNASVCO,B0002D0Q2W,Brother MOLOCH 969 MolochSorcery.com,Originally I purchased a Behringer EQ700 equalizer pedal for my rig. It was cheap at around $20+ some change but like the other reviewers noted its noisy with hiss. So I took the advice of another reviewer & bought the Fish & Chips model by Danaelectro and its terrific.I plugged it directly in line on my SKB pedal board turned them both on turned on the amp put it on clean then distortion channels while cranking up the volume to max & no discernible hiss nor hum. Mind you this is not a boutique pedal so there is a tiny bit of noise at full volume but not to the point it is noticeable.This pedal has a cool 1950s style & appearance. It has a great punch when you raise up the Level and the tone selections are great to help model various guitar & amp sounds. For a modifying pedal you cannot go wrong for the $30 price tag. If youre in the market for a great 7 band EQ pedal then youll be hard pressed to find one for the price of this one.This product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars.,Five Stars Without Hiss or Hum,1299283200,03 5 2011,Best
A1LS2UXHG1BYRG,B0002D0Q2W,Carlos De Cunha Carlos,I been playing guitar for 12+ years now. I play lead and rhythm. I needed a good EQ to sometimes scoop the sound a bit since I have a variety of guitars and they all sound different (some too much on the low and the others too much on the high). I dont like interfering with my mixer and amp settings and decided to get a pedal EQ instead. A boss EQ is solid and all yes but cost ALOT more. This EQ achieves almost the same results and I paid less! It has its own level BTW.,Great EQ,1299542400,03 8 2011,Best
A2EZWZ8MBEDOLN,B0002D0Q2W,Charlo,Ive been useing this pedal for several years and it does the job.  Yes it could be metal and I wish the button gave a satisfying click when I step on it.  For under thirty clams I can look past these things.  I have not had any issues with noise (crackling or oscillation).  I really have no complaints at all with its performance so I am glad I didnt shell out 3-4X more money so I can feel more secure when I unlatch my pedal board in front of gear-snobs.  I dont think I need to run this pedal with every amp I own but it does a great job opening up the sound of boxy or dark sounding amps.  When I run it in the effects loop of my Palomino V8 (great little practice amp btw) that little amp sounds HUGE.  Also great in front of my Blues Jr.  If you own an amp with a single tone knob (Pro Jr Valve Jr etc) or if you find your tone stack lacking responsiveness you owe it to yourself to buy one of these. Even if you are satisfied with the responsiveness of your amps controls this pedal can double as a volume boost when playing lead.  Once my sound is dialed in I leave typically leave it on and forget about it.  Its also pretty indespensible for shaping the sound of your amplified acoustic guitar-,GREAT PEDAL FOR THE MONEY,1311811200,07 28 2011,Good

AZE83O4F1IJPR,B0002D0Q2W,Matt,I needed an EQ pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting its EQ. Most distortion pedals I plugged into it ended up sounding way to &#34;bassy&#34; and so I bought this in hopes that it would help clear that up a little. I really didnt expect much since this pedal was so cheap; and for a brand new one at that; I was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids. If youre looking for a cheap way to dial in your tone for your guitar Id recommend this.,Insanely good pedal.,1399075200,05 3 2014,Best
A1GMWTGXW682GB,B0002D0Q2W,MetalFan,I bought this EQ pedal to use with a 70s amp project. I replaced the speaker and needed some mids so I bought this pedal to use for a clean channel. The EQ and boost works great for being a plastic box. I have seen the F&C; be called pure gold in a plastic box on a Telecaster forum and read reviews all over the net saying the same thing.The EQ works wonders for tone and is priced less than its MXR and Boss counterparts. I am not going to rehash all the other reviews but I use it with a bass/guitar amp and it works surprisingly well with the old amp and a passive bass. The boost combined with the 2 low bass EQs works wonders for low end.I use a Boss GE-7 EQ pedal with a different amp and the F&C; works as well as the Boss as long as you dont mind the cheap construction from Danelectro. I do not gig with the pedal so the plastic doesnt matter to me. I am wondering how long the switch will last though but at this price who can be critical.Some Danelectro pedals can be sorted into the novelty realm but this one is actually very functional and can open up all new sounds. I also tried the EQ with a Telecaster and the pedal gave me alot more bass and low end. I hope this lasts as long as my old all plastic FAB distortion that I bought used for $5.,great EQ for the price,1346198400,08 29 2012,Best
AW91VDERXXKGT,B0002D0Q2W,Nessander,These Danelectro pedals are great quality for the money. I use this pedal behind my dirt pedals for added flexibility and bringing out some more brilliance to the tone. The case is plastic not very attractive and perhaps not very sturdy. Also the button to push down for the effect leaves a bit to be desired -- it doesnt feel very solid. But I intend to use this more for recording than live use so Im not worried about that. Anyway there arent many EQs on the market and for the price it cant be beat. I would recommend it.,Good flexible EQ,1235260800,02 22 2009,Good
AFLRU6952DEFX,B0002D0Q2W,S.,Had this for about 3 years now - it works great and for 30 dollars it was a heck of a bargain.The construction is ok - its plastic with a metal + rubber bottom but seems sturdy.  Battery is easy to get in and out and comes with one (but is not shipped connected to the terminals).Signal wise if on it adds a tiny amount of hiss and static which raises the noise floor by a hair.  The noise isnt noticeable unless you are paying attention when turning it on or off.  Besides if you are boosting the high end you are going to get hiss.Works great in front for a clean or unclean boost but I tend to use it in the fx loop - where it does what its supposed to do.  I think its a must for getting the most out of an existing amp setup especially if the amps EQ isnt doing it for you or the cab or speaker choice is less than optimal - this thing fixes it all!I would definitely choose this over more expensive EQs but I tend to take good care of my stuff.,Amazing Value,1298332800,02 22 2011,Best

O. soo,This pedal fish and chips which i find it to taste nothing like works nicely.And was pretty cheap..Ive heard some complaints/worries about the flimsiness of the plastic.As of 03.13 the plastic seems pretty thick/durable.The switch does seem of a poor quality but if it did break im sure either send it in and get a new one or put a nicer switch in yourself.As for noise It doesnt seem to add much unless you have the gain switch at the end turned up high and with distortion and what have you.I havent gotten to blast (play bedroom level technically) since ive gotten it but it sounds good through the headphones.Im using a squire strat fryette sas distortion now the fish and chips boss me-50 all running into for now my vox vt20+ which is outputting to my headphones. soooo...Its sounding nicer that way.I cant wait to get it through my other amps.Ive also heard of very very short battery life.

Very responsive and never dull or weak sounding. Crisp highs and smooth lows that dont get &#34;mudded&#34; out.

AU9RL6MBM25YY,B0002DUPZU,Arlcay,I originally purchased these strings because of the 11-52 gauges. I wanted a set of strings that would have slightly lighter tension than a regular set of light gauge which is usually somewhere around 12-54. Upon installing these strings I cant really see much difference in size from the regular light gauge but maybe its too small to notice with the naked eye. Im not entirely sure that these strings were louder or a marked improvement over the old DAddario strings that they replaced. They might be a little brighter or have more clarity due to being new. The guitar that Im using them on is a small body with a nice mellow sound anyway so everything sounds nice and smooth.

They work well look good and are fairly durable at a very low price. I was remodeling an old Behringer and all I wanted was a fresh shiny set of new strings. For playing they sound pretty good. Best part in my opinion is that theyre made in America as well as the majority of Fender products.

A1MI9FDCNB3CMR,B0002DURNK,Jorge Barbarosa the_bassist,I use Fender strings and I have used many other brands as well.  I like Nickel for the reduced fret wear and the sound.  I change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit I can go 2 to 3 weeks for hard playing.I started using Fender strings with the Stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat.  They sounded great.  I use these for my telecaster in 10 -46 (factory spec) and they are real nice too.I do not recommend using stainless steel strings on guitars because stainless strings are like using stainless steel files on your frets.  I have seen some real damage in some cases in a relatively short time period.  Stick to nickel and you will be glad you did!,Fender Strings are great strings,1392681600,02 18 2014,Best
A356RFKNIG043B,B0002DURNK,K. Swanson,We geetarists are a funny bunch: well change out pots and caps and pups from our axes and amps all day long and spend a fortune doing it. But sometimes we could make more tonal difference by just spending five bucks!Case in point: pure nickel strings. Time was when that was all there was...and gee whiz that was a time when good guitar tone ruled. Coincidence? Nope. These things just sound better if by better you mean warmer and with a subtle feel that your fingers will convey to your brain in milliseconds. If youre used to wrapped strings and you like to play blues or classic rock or pretty much anything but metal these might be all you need to make your rig sound a whole lot sweeter and smoother and just more musical in general. Especially if you use tubes.Tubes and pure nickel are like Gilmour and Strats or Angus and SGs. They just fit.Im not nuts about Fender acoustic strings but I like their normal electric strings fine though Ernie Ball Slinkies have been my go-tos for many years. But these Fender pure nickels are very very nice and at 4.75 theyre a real deal. Most pure nickels run nearer to ten and these sound pretty much the same and I dont seem to break many of em neither. If youre used to mixed alloy pure nickels might seem a little dull but wait a bit and youll find that the harmonics are still there when the alloys have faded. Plus the feel is just smoother and nicer under the fingertips. Try a set and see what I mean. Its subtle but its beautiful.But the main reason I love these is for playing at VOLUME! I turned my modded Hot Rod Deluxe up to call-the-cops levels (the neighbors are getting used to it by now) louder than the drummer by a good chunk and I got: less squealing warmer tone by far and full chords triads and double stops that felt and sounded smoother and grinded with more harmonic warmth than any alloy string Ive ever used. I think theres an electrical cohesion between pure nickel and good pups and tubes that is simply sublime. Check out BBs tone on the legendary Live At The Regal to hear what I mean. Thats the stuff.So if you havent tried pure nickels spend a buck or two more (or maybe less!) than you normally do and give these bargain-priced nickels a try. You might find that youre a convert within seconds. I know that my ears sure love them when things are really cranked up; those Zep and Jimi riffs just sound and feel so much more right with pure nickel. And digging into some Otis Rush or Billy Gibbons licks is like night and day. The bluesy stuff just begs for pure nickels.Hell of a bargain at less than five bucks.,Pure nickel is where the tone is at,1397088000,04 10 2014,Best

A307Y5ACUY4RN6,B0002DUS8E,Reno,Ive used quite a few strings out there and imo these are the best for feel sound and overall quality. If you play Fender instruments you cant go wrong using their strings. Of course strings are a subjective thing so to each his own but I will say I used 2 different strings most of my life but was in a guitar store one day and picked up a Tele and was immediately impressed with the strings. I looked at the back and noticed they were colored ends so I thought they were DAddario strings which I found to be odd considering it was a new Fender. So I did a little research and found that Fender was indeed doing the colored ends now as well. Been buying them ever since and love them.,Fender Strings,1404259200,07 2 2014,Best
A14BICJ93WO926,B0002DV6RQ,Adam H,I think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges. What resulted for me was the perfect gauge string. They almost sound as good as mediums but feature the playability of lights. I also think these strings last a decent amount of time particularly if you wipe your strings after playing (which I need to get better at doing). Bottom line: I highly recommend these; they are the strings that I use and have been using for several years now.,My Favorite Acoustic Strings...,1311033600,07 19 2011,Best
A341MNU9GWBWKS,B0002DV6RQ,CaptainButts,Ive always played on light gauge strings and really wanted more sound out of my guitar so I found these and just took a gamble on this medium/light set and I was not disappointed. There was an immediate notice in sound difference and also the playablility of my guitar became a little more challenging. They offer a very warm tone with very good balance overall throughout the strings. Ive always liked Ernie Ball strings and these were a great starter set for me to upgrade to.

A121QRWXZIO6UP,B0002DV6RQ,Jarrett Venturini,This set of strings is fantastic. Ive been playing for over ten years now and have tried everything from Elixirs to DAddario to Martin to John Pearse (you see where Im going with this?)and many more.I have to say that for the money these strings are in a class of their own.  When I first started playing I loved the coated strings.  I wouldnt buy anything but Elixirs for years!  Then I got married and money became tight and for $15 a pop a set Elixirs wasnt looking as good as they used to.So I tried every other set of strings under the sun for about three years.I finally landed on these Earthwoods by Ernie Ball.  Amazing!They are not coated but after a while I got used to that and now actually prefer non-coated strings.These really do bring out the earthy tones of my dreadnought.  And the Medium Light set is just perfect!  Nice size high E string so I dont feel like Im going to snap it when I do a pull off and good bass response.All in all a fantastic set of strings that you cant afford not to try.And at $5 why wouldnt you give them a shot?,Great Strings,1338336000,05 30 2012,Best

A34LQ791ACZ0JC,B0002DV6RQ,karaoke music lover,Ive used GHS medium bronze wound strings on my Martin D-18 for several years. I thought Id give these Ernie Ball strings a shot after reading reviews. They are lighter than I expected. They are closer to light than medium. Im not that impressed. They sound too bright and occasionally rattle on the frets. I think the next set I buy will be medium and probably GHS. You never know until you try.Update: Ive gotten used to the sound of these strings and I DO like that they are easier on the old fingers when playing. Pure Bluegrass players like to torture their fingers with heavier strings to get that mellow BG sound though. ;) At my age I need all the help I can get so Ill have to admit that I like do like these strings.,First Time Trying Ernie Ball Strings,1343865600,08 2 2012,Good

A1GMWTGXW682GB,B0002DV6RQ,MetalFan,I built a CBG recently and decided to go with these strings as suggested on several websites. The sound I get from the AD&G strings sound great wit the piezo pickup and a tube amp. The strings seem to hold up well. I cannot comment on how well they hold a tune because anyone who knows cigar box guitars knows that keeping them in tone with parts like round head bolts for a nut and an eye bolt for a bridge can be an uphill battle.

They dont take up a lot of room and theyre very light and portable if you want to take them with you to a gig or if youre traveling.  I highly recommend it.My guitar teacher suggested that I keep my guitar(s) out because he said that if I kept it/them in a visible easily-accesible place that I would practice more even if it was just a few minutes and he was absolutely right.  Instead of zipping them up and putting them away in their respective bags/cases after each practice session I have them all out and displayed and I definitely practice and play more because as soon as I step into the room - there they are I just pick any one of them up and start playing.  It was a simple tip that sounded like common sense but I hadnt realized that I always had the excuse that I didnt have time to practice -- but really the effort of getting the gig bag and unzipping it and taking out the guitar even though that seems like very little effort and doesnt take up a lot of time for some reason kept me from practicing.  I guess out of sight out of mind.  But now I keep my guitars out and I also bought a music stand and I keep the music Im working on and the stand out.  Yes it takes up room and stuff but whatever gets me to practice more and play more is always very helpful.,Great stand for a great price,1345766400,08 24 2012,Best

A2T2SAJS88MYU4,B0002DV7ZM,NoKidding,It was cheap to buy but works just fine. I thought it might not be tall enough to hold my guitar securely but it does. The arms are coated with a soft material that prevents scratching. It is small but the arms stretch to hold almost any guitar securely. Perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar. In that case I would recommend a stand that is taller and heavier.,Small convenient and effective,1369094400,05 21 2013,Best

People set their guitars on the desks from which they sometimes fall. Bad scene (sounds like an old El Kabong cartoon) and not what I want to have happen to my new Seagull Artist series guitar. This little Fender stand easily folds up into a package small enough to fit in the storage pocket of my deluxe TRIC case so I can take it with me to class.Its not the sturdiest most secure or most stable design out there but given its extreme portability and the use Ill put it to its going to work great.,Great design extreme portability,1293667200,12 30 2010,Best

A3H4S6YO9VNGDZ,B0002E1G5C,Anthony J.,I like this product so much I buy them two at a time but I wish I didnt have to. The problem is that everyone else likes it as much as me! So its like that guy who asks for a lighter...uses it...and puts it in his pocket every single time these also seem to grow feet and disappear just like the lighter.I understand people coveting tools that work this well and are so convenient but if it turns them into kletptos maybe it should contain a stain pack to catch them like bank robbers.Its a decent tool at a good price so buy one...Then see how long you can own it!,Very Useful...BUT,1394755200,03 14 2014,Best
A3DZBMO93FHKTH,B0002E1G5C,arleas,It works fine for the regular guitars but the bass guitar has these very wide tuning pegs.  This winder has a slot that will sorta fit across this tuning peg but it doesnt feel like it has enough of a grip to make turning it easier.I havent had a chance to actually use it while changing strings yet but so far it looks like itll work as advertised in every other aspect.,It doesnt fit my Bass Guitar as well as I had hoped,1402790400,06 15 2014,Good
AROOYR32BS1VL,B0002E1G5C,Astraeus,This is basically the Leatherman Multi tool for guitarist. By Leatherman I really mean Planet Waves - The go to sure shot company that will provide solid guitar products and accessories (I buy cables picks straps from Planet Waves so.. I guess you could say Im a fan of their company) And by multi-tool I really mean this Pro Winder String Winder and Cutter. Everything you need to know is in the title! It helps to wind your guitar strings the grip is comfortable and durable and once youve tuned your guitar you can clip off the excess guitar string. Awesome! But wait... theres more (I should be on an infomercial) Theres also a nifty little pin puller for when you re-string your acoustic instruments. For the price this does everything and more... I recommend if you need a winder just buy this. Youll take out 3 birds with one stone even if you only needed to take out one bird...... if that makes sense? Cheers!,Awesome,1369440000,05 25 2013,Best

A2FIYXK97CTS6D,B0002E1G5C,B. Clark,I ordered the product thinking it was going to be the answer to all my dreams but alas I was wrong. The winding apparatus works beautifully but the cutter doesnt allow me to get a short enough cut on the strings for my preference so Im back to using metal pliers to snip the strings close to the post. All in all a good product to have if you dont have pliers on hand or dont mind getting a closer snip.I cannot comment on the peg remover since my acoustic doesnt have pegs - luckily the strings are fed through the slots on the back of the bridge which I think is a much better design than guitars with pegs to hold strings in place. Each to their own I suppose.,Houston we have windage.,1404518400,07 5 2014,Good
A3RDS0DJ5EJGA7,B0002E1G5C,B,This is such a lifesaver (or an effort saver). Every guitarist should have this. In my opinion there is nothing more annoying in the world than changing guitar strings. This makes the process so much easier. Its a 3-in-1 product that clips the old string pulls the pins out and winds the new strings in. On top of it all its pretty affordable.,New and improved version,1365984000,04 15 2013,Best
A1EUO0BU72JR7T,B0002E1G5C,Bilbo,The winder works well for me and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so I dont have to search out a pair of snips) but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward.  Also the bridge pin puller is kinda flimsy and doesnt work well for reluctant pins.  I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more but I guess thats the compromise of having a working cutter so I wont be throwing away my other winder any time soon.,Works well but not perfect..,1316044800,09 15 2011,Good
A1S7QABO64Z554,B0002E1G5C,Bob B Bob B,I was a bit concerned about this tool after reading some reviews that owners had damaged expensive guitars but thought I would just be careful with it.  But I have no concerns after using it on two string changes.  In fact I cannot see how one could nick the guitar while winding since the tool does not even cover the entire tuning key so it never gets close the guitar head.  The string cutter works great one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly.  The pry tool for acoustic guitar pegs works and though it is a tighter fit than I expected it does work and means I dont need to find a pliers.  Overall I am very pleased and saved time on string changes.,Great Tool for guitar owners,1392854400,02 20 2014,Best

AB39UO500J4EP,B0002E1G5C,CaptAdams35,String changes usually take me 10 to 12 minutes each but I restrung all 3 of my guitars in less than 13 minutes (one is a floating tremolo). The spanner is smooth the cutter is strangely very clean cutting (usually use electrician wire dykes) and the pin puller is nothing fancy but does the trick quickly. Awesome little tool and very impressed with it. A++++ on every function would consider maybe putting a few small rubber inserts on the handle for those sweaty hands but other than that its perfectly perfect.

A2BT968XSRPP0K,B0002E1G5C,CJB Cjb,Before bying this product I doubted a little whether or not this gadget wouldd cut the metale strings. I received it and the first thing I did is try it. IT CUTS THE MEDAL STRINGS LIKE BUTTER. I used to use whatever I could find around the house which was a pain because nothing I tried could cut these metal strings.

A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0002E1G5C,Daniel G. Lebryk,Light weight compact and all in one tool what more could I ask for?This tool does three things very well turns tuners on stringed instruments quickly cuts musical instrument strings and helps pull acoustic guitar string pins. Whats not to like? Well the cutter part of the tool is a little hard to open - guess Im used to side cutters or pliers - and it doesnt cut strings really close to the tuning pin - it leaves about a half inch of string hanging. Oh if you actually follow the three loops of string theory for stringing your guitar (go to the Elixir Strings website and watch the excellent guitar stringing videos from the Taylor guitar factory) your wrist will get a little tired turning the crank for the tuners. The alternative is a battery operated turner that weighs a ton more.I find it very hard to believe that with normal use on stringed instrument strings somebody could manage to break this plastic tool. The tool is made of sturdy plastic. If abused trying to cut copper wire it might break; but the tool was never designed for that use.Ive used this tool now for several months and expect that it will last for a very long time. I use this on three different guitars an acoustic and two electrics (Les Paul and PRS). The pin puller works just fine I actually put a rag on the guitar body to prevent any dents in the wood. The tool fits inside my hard shell Gibson guitar case. This is a very nice tool.,Does Exactly What Is Described,1285459200,09 26 2010,Best

I just wanted a string winder at first but thought this one was kinda cool and reasonably priced too. I didnt expect the string cutter to be as well as it is. I thought my wire cutters would be much better but the cutter on this baby is just as great! It also has a pin puller which I havent tried yet but Im sure its great as well.

A1VFUMY02HJIFY,B0002E1G5C,D. Dreifus,Primarily purchased to have a string cutter in the guitar case rather than going to get one from my tool box.Found the pin puller did not really work for me so put my old string winder from 20 yrs. ago back in the case to use that pin puller which worked just fine. Seemed no matter how I tried I was almost scratching the saddle tried to get that groove under the head of the pins and could never get it to work on a six string steel acoustic guitar.It seems that &#34;C&#34; shaped opening in the end is for stretching strings and I find that is better done by hand. So really I just use this for the wire cutter feature.  And the string winder itself also works well.,String cutter works pin puller not so much,1369526400,05 26 2013,Good

A1O7G2PW6LGL0G,B0002E1G5C,digitel,This is a great tool the only issue was it was a little tight and it squeaked loudly as i was attempting to use it..  i had some graphite powder and i put a little around the screw head on the winder part and now it spins freely without noise.  Its so much nicer to not have to wind those tuner heads by hand when changing strings out.  the wire cutters also work really well.

A1IT51TW0UI2LM,B0002E1G5C,D.

A95J3RNEFN425,B0002E1G5C,Don Geeze,Works a little better at winding strings than the bare-bones winders. The string cutter is very handy. The pin puller as is usually the case is a little clumsy to use but it works.,Nice gadget,1398988800,05 2 2014,Best
A1IJUUNPU7L6LA,B0002E1G5C,Don On The Upper Cumberland,Finally a winder that has features and durability designed into it.  The pocket of the winder head appears to be large enough to handle any tuning peg head size and the molded plastic body appears to be thick enough to stand up to a lot of use.  The pivot point doesnt bind when using the winder as has a couple other cheaper models Ive purchased (and thrown away) over the years.  The string cutter is a great feature and appreciated works well regardless of string composition type...stainless chromes core-types etc.  The price seems fair enough.  Ive seen a couple of battery powered models for not much more money but if youre in that big a hurry to change strings youre living life too fast...... get a roadie to do it for you.... why have to remember to carry spare batteries.,Quality and Design,1264204800,01 23 2010,Best

A3M1PLEYNDEYO8,B0002E1G5C,G. Thomas Tom,Not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder.  Thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but not quiet up to par.  Youll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips.,OK but!,1212537600,06 4 2008,Bad
A8ANJNZAZQ6IQ,B0002E1G5C,Guitar Operator Guitar Operator,Terrific All-in-One Must-Have Tool for Guitarists!I have been using the older style Planet Waves model of this winder/cutter/bridge pin tool and when it came in I was a little skeptical about the new model.I am happy to see that the changes are relatively minor and if anything it is just a little bit smaller so it will fit inside your case compartment more easily leaving more room for other junk.I have used the Planet Waves tolls for years without any difficulty or problems with breaking bending becoming dull or unusable.

A3IICSS30MRX9M,B0002E1G5C,Handsome Johnny,Not as sturdy as some Ive used and seen floating around but it gets the job done as advertised.  Not a terrible buy.  Construction is a bit on the cheap side though as it is mostly plastic and seems a bit fragile around the edges.  The clipper and winder work well though even though they are both predominantly made of the same lower grade material.  However all you really need are the two functions and they work.,Not as sturdy as some but works as advertised,1297900800,02 17 2011,Good

A2M8T1A4O0GS72,B0002E1G5C,Huevos Rancheros Eggsactly,This bad boy rocks fits in guitar case it slices it dices it makes julienne fries. Well no but  it does slice guitar strings in half and it will pull bridge pins and wind/unwind guitar strings though.If it had a flashlight tuner and fingernail trimmer it would be perfect but engineers are mortal and I couldnt put a tool the size of a watermelon inside my guitar case (at least not without coating it with butter first).Its plastic and steel it will break eventually as everything does - imperfect world re &#34;breakfast club&#34; bolts fall out doors fall off but til then Ill enjoy using this. The string winder is a little awkward. I have a little fender brand gizmo that looks like a pez dispenser with a swivel head on top its small so I keep it in the guitar case along with this contraption - winds strings much faster than this device but if youve got the time this one will work just fine. I also wear two pairs of socks in case one gets a hole in it Im prone to redundancies.It may be sheer rumor but I have it on good sources that this item is actually based on alien technology recovered at Roswell New Mexico.

AMVC9WTXYKNJ1,B0002E1G5C,J. Edgar Mihelic Skyscraper,Im not sure how much extra utility you get out of the winder.  Maybe if you change strings a lot then this could be a key part of you equipment bag.  The cutter part is nice it is solid and effective without being too heavy yet it does feel well made.  For the price keep it around rather than tracking down other wire cutters when you need to change out a set of strings.,Capable cutter.,1376524800,08 15 2013,Good

It takes me a fraction of the time it used to take changing strings I can have them all loosened and cut in seconds where before I would stand there cranking one tuning peg for what seemed like forever.

A56EP6FFRH1YT,B0002E1G5C,J. Kim,I bought this mainly for the string cutter although it has a peg winder and a bridge pin puller as well. At first I was skeptical because its lightweight and the cutting ends are not sharp. I was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings. Im happy to say that it does an excellent job much better than the pair of diagonal pliers I was using.  It cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly.  Its nice not having to carry the pliers around which are heavier and a little risky to your guitar should you happen to drop it or accidentally mar your headstock. As for the bridge pin puller I tried it once but it is rather ineffective. I think it was included more as an afterthought as its just a notched edge and cant really pull stuck pins. For pulling bridge pins without damaging the bridge I would recommend the Dunlop bridge pin puller which is inexpensive.Overall I give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter. Id recommend this to any acoustic guitarist as an essential tool to keep in their guitar case.,Excellent string cutter,1283731200,09 6 2010,Best

I tried unscrewing it and putting a little oil on the screw head but it didnt make much difference. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. I was using a set of flush cut nips but they kept getting bent trying to cut the hard nickel and steel of guitar strings. These work much better. They dont cut the string they shear it off.

A2Z15UQEUTE3T9,B0002E1G5C,Leon2142,When i bought this i didnt think it was going to be as good as it is. It seemed a little plastic-ie from the photos so i didnt think it was going to hold up very well. It actually really surpassed my expectations however. The winder itself works quite well and has slots for multiple-sized tuners. It was a little wobbley on my guitar but still worked well. The wire cutter was able to cut the thickest guitar string with little problem. For 7 dollars its a really good deal!,This thing is awesome!,1387497600,12 20 2013,Best

A2D0F87RY5YMHN,B0002E1G5C,Levis Ouellet,I have purchased and used many various types of Guitar String Winders and I must admit that the Planet Waves Pro Winder is the very best I have used to date.  It is an all in one and there is no need to carry extra equipment to cut the strings....pull pegs..etc.  It is sturdy and should last  many moons and cut many strings before needing replacement.  Because of the affordable price on Amazon I will be buying some for my friends as Christmas Stocking Stuffers.  The Planet Waves Pro Winder is well worth the cost and I recommend it to anyone.  Also with the string winder I also purchased accoustic guitar strings and requested regular shipping (free shipping) which promised that the items would be shipped within 5 to 7 days. The items were ordered on the Thursday and received on the Saturday....THREE SHORT DAYS...Treat yourself!  Thank you Amazon!,Planet Waves Pro Winder,1352246400,11 7 2012,Best

A52GGV55KT8AV,B0002E1G5C,Melissa,I know that you can easily change strings without paying for a tool to help you out but honestly this thing is worth every penny. It cuts your changing time down drastically.

With this winder you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts that on the bottom &#34;E&#34; I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all.,Super nice,1373068800,07 6 2013,Best
A19Q4B515ENF9C,B0002E1G5C,Richard L. Chism,Overall I like this winder.  Its handy having the wire cutter built into it.  But when I am winding new strings it often slips off.  Since I am using one hand to hold tension on the new string I would prefer this to hold on more securely so I dont have to put it back on several times.  But all in all its a lot better than winding by hand and it seems sturdy.,Does the job but sometimes slips off when turning.,1387929600,12 25 2013,Good
A91PW87FR65XH,B0002E1G5C,R. J. Province Blade,It beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet but it could be better.1. It slips off if you go too fast but I thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this.2. It didnt come with much of any instructions so I was using it wrong at first. There is a big and a small slot.3. The cutter is so that I pinched my finger during use. The cutter works great you just have to be careful.4. The screw that holds it on keeps coming loose. Sure I can tighten it but it just means the design could be better.All and all its one of those must have gadgets but it does require a little discipline to master. I hope the next version comes with a soft rubber insert so it doesnt scratch the chrome off my turner pegs. That and maybe they could use a long screw and some Loctite to keep it from coming loose. And well maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find. Everything I have seems to be jet black.,Handy Little Gadget...,1297296000,02 10 2011,Good

A1CF9IF5FWYNU0,B0002E1G5C,Robert Baxter,The wire clipper and winder work O.K. but the pin puller is badly designed and doesnt slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out.

It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. The shipping cost were almost as high as the cost of the item itself making the purchase of this item an unfavorable purchase price for a single item.

AFB7MSIPJIW68,B0002E1G5C,Seph,Ive had string winders for years but never a multifunction one like this. I recently bought it for my niece and taught her how to change her strings.The different size gaps make it grab the tuning pegs much better than my old one. I was able to use it on an electric steel string acoustic and classical and it grabbed them all rather well. The string cutter works well and the peg puller does also. So handy!,So useful,1344988800,08 15 2012,Best
A10FM4ILBIMJJ7,B0002E1G5C,Sim,I used this a couple of days ago to change strings on my electric guitar (Fender Strat). I was suprised in how well the little wire cutters worked. The end that turns the machine tuners is a little loose feeling but it still works well you just have to be a little carful about not allowing it to slip and to not over tighten the strings. I highly recommend it.,A handy gadget to have arround.,1382140800,10 19 2013,Best
A85AE6BNHXAXR,B0002E1G5C,Skip,Its nice having all of the tools on one device. The pin puller is very slim and works better than the puller on the basic string winders. I like to trim my strings and the cutters also work well.,Good All-In-One Tool,1393027200,02 22 2014,Good

A3HKZSCGFU9T2A,B0002E1G5C,Teagan Mago,It functions as designed.  It saves time when restringing a guitar.  Its made pretty well for a plastic tool.

A202CZ4PJH83G4,B0002E1G5C,Tinfoot,I honestly really didnt find this thing useful at all. First the wire clipper side is relatively bulky (no flush cutting) and doesnt open easily (very stiff action) so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick. And as for the winder... I suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner. But it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything I used it on so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit. Plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesnt help. Didnt even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing. Just looked at it... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.Each time I have set out to use it I end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string. I just recently ended up buying a set of Crescent Brand Miniature Cutters & Needle-Nose Pliers Set(the pliers are JUST the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding). When I have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar Ill try the notch bridge peg puller. But other wise this thing gets a serious two-star &#34;meh&#34;.,Hasnt made things any easier,1322265600,11 26 2011,Bad

ALHC64J88LVWO,B0002E1G5C,Wayfinder,When I first saw this item I wondered:  Why is the regular guitar version $6.99 and the bass version only $4.99?Suddenly an amazing clarity came over me and I realized-- the bass version only has to tune FOUR strings instead of six.  So it costs less because we dont need to use it as much!But then I remembered there are 5 string bass guitars and I thought okay... shouldnt they have a $5.99 one for 5-string bass guitars?Sadly the universal clarity became even more muddied when I realized with some dismay that there are even 6-string bass guitars.  Will this even work on a 6-string bass?  After all thats 2 more strings than its intended purpose!These perplexing questions aside I find this to be an excellent and ideal tool.  Its function is three-fold:1) String winder2) String cutter3) Peg pullerSo no more running for the wire clippers to pull a peg or cut a string.  All the tools you need to change strings are in this one reasonably-priced tool.  Made by Daddario the quality lives up to the brand.  Its solid the wire cutter and peg puller well designed.  It does everything its supposed to do does it well and is of good construction.PROS:  Good strong well-designed unitCONS: The winder is held on by a single screw and there are numerous reports of that screw coming unscrewed during use.  I would recommend putting a drop of super glue down in the screw thread area to secure the screw and prevent that happening. Because of this design flaw 4 stars instead of 5.I note that there are reviews here as old as four years... and it appears this device has undergone design changes during that time.  Some say the head bowl is so deep it can result in scratching of the guitar head.  Others report it being so shallow it slips off the keys.What I believe is that it is a mistake to sell the BASS and STANDARD GUITAR version on the same page.  From what I can deduce from the reviews it appears some folks have inadvertently purchased the BASS guitar version which does indeed have a wide and deep cup and did not realize it.  Imho the two products should be listed on two different pages for clarity.  Its obvious from the reviews that some folks have accidentally purchased the wrong unit.Some have reported the peg puller being metal and scratching the bridge.  The one on mine is vinyl and while it is hard enough to scratch the bridge if one isnt careful-- the same holds true for needle nose pliers.Bottom line is there is some responsibility of the user to pay attention to what theyre doing dont get in a rush and be aware of the need to protect their instrument while using ANY modification tool. I suspect if one is going to get in a hurry and try to change strings 0 to 60 in 5 seconds... they may wind up damaging their guitar.  Turn on the light put on reading glasses if necessary to see... and take your time and this device should work fine.  Be aware when reading reviews that many seem to be out of date (dunno why the company didnt simply start a new listing when redesigning the device).,So many questions so many questions...,1385337600,11 25 2013,Good

Everything here is as far as I can tell just as advertised - a way to keep ones instruments in good shape.I now have a shine on my guitar that is better than when it arrived from the factory and there doesnt seem to be any chemicals in the stuff that corrodes or otherwise destroys the guitar like perhaps some fly-by-night cheapy cheapy product maker might offer.Maybe there are better polishes and waxes out there - and knowing the way the world works Im sure there are some probably made out of rare elephant glandular excretions that sell for $500 a bottle that the pros use and maybe would be worth 6 or 7 stars on the Amazon review.

A13KBLFF4IZF7H,B0002E1H9W,L. Dustin,The products work great applied them to my new Les Paul Ukulele for protection. The strings that came with my ukulele were junk so I decided to replace them with aquila strings. Prior to doing so I decided that I would like to prep the fret board. The frets seemed a little rough and the rosewood looked a little dry to me so....I ordered this kit to see what it would do. It comes with both fret board cleaner and even a very fine grit emery cloth for the metal frets. I thought I would try the emery cloth on the frets and was very pleased with the results. The frets are now very smooth and shiny and the rosewood fret board looks like it is much happier after a little drink.The polish for the instrument brought out a deep luster...but remember a little goes a long way so the wax should last a very long time as I am sure the other products will too.The cloths are very soft and should not damage you instrument. Mine came soaked due to the 02 bottle leaking upon arrival. That is the reason I did not give this product a 5 star. It looked like the package was damaged prior to shipment since the out side package was pristine and the product was protected well inside with adequate padding.I am now going to work on my Gibson Les Paul Custom Guitar and I am sure that I will be very happy with the results!Great product which would deserve the full 5 stars if it was packaged a little better.,Product works great but lost a star due to damage of the products package.,1357257600,01 4 2013,Good

I could not believe how much residue was on the rag after I cleaned the fret board yuk.  Then I used the 02 treatment product to treat it and it really brought out the natural color.  Id like to say it looks like new but the guitar is a 1967 so that would be a stretch.But it looks a heck of a lot better almost new.  I used it on one of my less valuable acoustics but its still a 67 USA made Fender.  I have such faith in this that Im going to do my 77 Gibson acoustic next.Then I have a couple of electrics I will do when I change strings on them.

A2M8T1A4O0GS72,B0002E1I2I,Huevos Rancheros Eggsactly,Nice little kit. it has 800 grit sandpaper in it I hadnt noticed that in the listing maybe I overlooked it. I had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade. The 600 made it glassy smooth again (wet sanding) - I used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for me.I had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board. Big mistake it deadened the sound terrible. I was miserable my guitar sounded like s***.After 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and Bobs your uncle good as new. Im going to use this everytime I change strings on all my guitars.Nice little kit I might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days.

A19Q4B515ENF9C,B0002E1I2I,Richard L. Chism,I bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape.  I guess this kit works okay but its hard to use.  It will probably last my entire lifetime.  I think a smaller kit would have been better.  You really need to remove the strings when you use it so you have to take off all the strings.  I usually only replace one string at a time when I am changing strings so I had to change my habits.  If you have a guitar without a truss rod that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after youre done changing the strings since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned.  Im no expert but I have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent.  However since I love my guitar I use it anyway.,I guess this works but its kind of a pain to use.,1387929600,12 25 2013,Average

I have to say though that I believe a big bottle of eye glass cleaner to clean the fretboard with and a good furniture polish would work just as well. Since you only use a small amount the kit will last a long time so it isnt a bad buy. Just remember it isnt recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it. If you want to use this type of product then I recommend this one.,It works as advertised.,1382140800,10 19 2013,Good

A1SG6JGU7ISEH3,B0002E1J3Q,Nunya Bizness,I have used Ernie Ball strings for along time.  Mostly slinkys or super slinkys.  I read the review on these and thought I would give these a try for the sound they make paired with a LP.I bought these to replace the stockers on the EPI LP 100 I just bought.  Luckily I order two packs.  I was putting on the top E string and had turned the crank less than a few times not near enough tension on the string yet to even be in tune yet and pop it broke. I had ordered two sets so I put on the one from the new set. No problems until I got to the G string then pop another breaker. Very sad quality.After finally getting them on and in tune (you will need to stretch the top 3 strings alot to get them to stay in tune especially the E) I have to say they have a great sound to them.  Nice tone and sustain.  Great crucnhy sound for metal but still a good clean tone too.  These are thick strings but still bendable just not very far.  I would rate the sound 5 stars.Unfortunately it takes two packs of strings for one successful stringing to occur because of how brittle the strings are.  So I have to give these three stars overall.,Great sound but fickle quality,1327104000,01 21 2012,Average

Of course over the years Ive tried other strings but always seem to come back to  Ernie Ball strings . There are no surprises. The quality Is always the same. Also I believe the very best value for the dollar. From extra slinky to heavy gauge Jazz strings  You just cant go wrong.

A2F2L5F9OWWVY6,B0002E1J5E,AT,Im not a metal player in any means but sometimes I do get the urge. If your gonna play metal you need bigger strings than just 46-9. So I got these and they are awesome. They are not too big or too small. Very happy with these strings. If you want GREAT strings get fender strings. They are the best out there.

A34EGGJLO553D8,B0002E1J5E,Christian Matthew,I use earnie ball strings as my backup strings. They dont have as nice and clear a tone as my daddario or curt mangan strings nor do they have the life expectancy however they are cheaper and really easy to bend. Since I cant afford to restring with the more pricey strings every single time I go with these when Im practicing. They do break alot when I play some crazy solos which blows and is the main reason why Im not giving them 5s. (No its not my technique Ive never broken a string on any other brand strings Ive tried.) When Im in the studio recording I prefer like I said before Daddario or curt mangan strings however to save money I practice with these strings and I think its not a bad method as I go through strings like doritos (I eat doritos alot).,Good for backups,1329004800,02 12 2012,Good
A2QPZKGUDE7RJ4,B0002E1J5E,nette,I read a review saying that there bridge was floating out & the strings were hard to tune aswell as their e string popping. I had the exact same experience but i bought two sets since i know uncoated strings dont last long. so i did get to play em but all my strings (except the A & E) popped on both sets within two weeks i knew it was due to my bridge being made to use a whammy bar (which it came with btw)& the tension it put on my tuning pegs what really got me upset about these strings was that they damaged my tuning pegs and now there harder to turn (have to use pliers sometimes) but the strings sound great & if i get a better guitar i might get these more often but for now im staying w/ medium gauge elixirs.,Ok strings,1336435200,05 8 2012,Average

A2KKZHISX9YKMI,B0002E1J5E,PJY pjsailor,This isnt a review of these strings so much as a warning or caveat for those of you playing guitars with floating bridges (usually for a whammy bar) and not using these heavier strings already.I wanted a little fuller sound than the 10-46 slinky strings (aka regular slinky) and the idea of some driving base appealed to me so ordered the beefys. I strung them up but had a hard time tuning the guitar. Every time I got the higher strings in tune the lowers would go down as much as a half note. It took awhile to realize that my floating bridge was coming off the body as I tightened the strings. So I pulled the back plate off my strat and set to off tighten down the the tensions screws. I made about 5 adjustments each time retuning the guitar to check my progress. The final time I tightened them down the high E string broke. Since these were my only beefys my day was done with these strings. However given how far I tightened the tension screws I think I would have had to purchase an additional tension spring (not too expensive or difficult to install if you have the inclination to do it) to get the bridge flush with the body.As I said this isnt a knock of these strings. I never really got a chance to play them. Just a heads up for anyone moving up to these heavier strings. It can be quite a shock the first time your see your bridge sticking out at a 45 degree angle to your guitar and if you arent careful you can damage your guitar.,Beware Guitars with floating bridges,1329782400,02 21 2012,Good

A2F92AOWTIUIB,B0002E1J5E,StudioDude,I wouldnt recommend tuning these strings to E however because the intense amount of tension it takes to tune these to E can cause permanent damage to the neck that not even the truss rod can fix. The highest I feel comfortable tuning these to is E flat.

A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B0002E1NNM,Daniel G. Lebryk,These acoustic strings are used on a Laguna acoustic guitar. They are just the right weight and just the right amount of flex. Weve tried DAddario brighter sound (DAddario Acoustic Guitar Strings Set EXP 80/20 Lite) and Martin a little stiff (Martin Strings SP Phosphor Bronze 12.5-55 MSP4150). In the end these Elixirs sound and feel best on this guitar.As has been said there is no perfect guitar string for everyone. The perfect guitar string is the one that feels and sounds right to you on your guitar. For the combination we have these are outstanding strings.On the strings lasting longer thats hard to say. Fresh strings do sound better. Its clear that the wound strings do not corrode like non-coated strings. But Im not certain these last so much longer. We buy them because they sound good and have the right amount of flex to them - playability. Corrosion or crud on the string isnt the sole factor in changing strings.June 15 2010 Update: Elixir is a wonderful company. On my third or fourth sets of Elixir strings the G string snapped as my son was tuning the guitar for the first time. Elixir is outstanding they will replace any string that doesnt perform up to your standard.The other amazing thing - Ive watched tons of videos and watched a lot of guys change strings and Im still very confused. The Elixir website (its pretty simple elixirstring dot com) is outstanding. Ther is a two part video from the Taylor factory on how to change strings. I swear that if you follow those instructions you will change strings in minutes. It is so simple and so reproducible.

A2C7BOQVFH1HLE,B0002E1NNM,Frederick Baptist,Ive been playing guitar for over twenty years now and Ive tried just about every guitar string in existance and even these Elixir coated strings.  Ive come to realise that the benefits for a slightly longer life barely makes sense given the much higher price you have to pay for it.  Eventually all strings corrode and lose their lustre and if you are a professional playing gigs you change your strings so often anyway that to pay much more for polycoating doesnt make any sense.  If you are the kind that occasionally takes out the axe then maybe this would make a difference but what I do is I get the least expensive ones and make sure I wipe down and clean them even using products like string cleaners and Fast Fret to reduce finger squeak if necessary and my strings last for quite some time as well except at a much lower cost.Few people know this but only a few guitar stringmakers exist in the U.S. and many of them that are retailed are actually the same strings with different brand names.  Granted Elixir probably isnt one of these as they try to make hay with the time they have left on their patent of this polycoating technology but my thing is why pay so much more for strings when the benefit you get is really not so substantial as to justify the price?  I myself use generic Kyser stings for my classical and acoustic guitars and Memphis Electrics for my electric just because they are the cheapest I could find on the web and my sound has not been detrimentally affected in any way.  In fact you are much more likely to improve upon your sound by using better amps and guitar cables than you are with strings; at least most people would be able to hear the difference.  Dont get me wrong these Elixir strings are not bad but you are much more likely to get a better sound by improving your technique (practice) getting better cables pickups amps guitars etc than from just using these strings.  For better string life just wipe down and clean the strings before and after use.  This discipline once a habit is good enough.Peace!,Take Good Care of Your Strings and They Will Last Longer!,1284595200,09 16 2010,Average

A3SDJ70H00OQCJ,B0002E1NNM,JerryWithaJ,Theres NO SUCH THING as a best string.  From experimenting over the years Ive found that while I have old standbys that will be the first thing I try often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar.Coated strings have become all the rage over the last few years.  Theyre expensive but they last a lot longer especially if you have the kind of body chemistry that causes them to corrode quickly.  Also they minimize the amount of finger noise you get if you slide on the strings.Elixir Polywebs were the first coated string.  The coating is much heavier than that of other strings.  This produces a much less bright more muted sound.  I have an old koa guitar that is so bright I cant stand it with standard strings.  The Elixir Polywebs tone it down to the point where its perfect.If youre looking for a darker sound then Elixir Polywebs are definitely worth a shot.  If you want a coated string but prefer the brighter sound of uncoated strings then you definitely dont want Polywebs.The 4 stars applies if you want this particular type of sound.  If you dont want this sound you could end up awarding them 1 star.,It depends...,1151107200,06 24 2006,Good

A21GCOGHDQNHQS,B0002E1NQ4,JVincent,I used this strap for the first time during a rehearsal last night. I typically practice sitting down without a strap when I am alone but stand up when rehearsing or performing with a band. I had previously used a very expensive 2 padded leather cradle type strap which I really liked. I sold that banjo and the strap with it but recently re-acquired another banjo and wanted a good strap but was not willing to pay the $80 again for a premium padded leather strap. I saw all of the great reviews for this strap and the affordable price and took a chance. I am glad I did.This strap may not be as elegant as fine leather but it is made extremely well and feels very durable and substantial in its construction. What blew me away is that my full tone ring banjo which weighs about 14 pounds literally felt half as heavy. It is no joke. At first the feeling was unnerving because the strap has some elastic give to it. You get this dual sensation of a) the banjo feeling super light and b) as if the banjo is going to sink to the floor. Paradoxical I know but thats where the magic of this strap is. It is almost as if the banjo is floating in front of you but in reality it remains very stable when playing.Like I said the build quality is outstanding. My only critique of the design is that it is very modern and non-traditional so you also have to get used to the contrast of a traditional instrument like a 5-string bluegrass banjo and the newer style and design of this strap.This is not just a good strap for the money rather it is a great strap at any price point. I think I might try these on my electrics (though I already have literally hundreds of dollars invested in a stable of those high end padded leather straps).,Excellent but takes some getting used to,1374796800,07 26 2013,Good

A1S7QABO64Z554,B0002E1O2C,Bob B Bob B,I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store.  Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string.  Have 2 problems with the strings.  First the bass E (11th string) broke while tuning it up.  Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not Elixir).  I have changed strings many many times so I am convinced it was not my stringing but a weakness in the E string itself.  Second the high D (8th string) seems dead; it does not ring as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets Ive used).  Considering these strings cost much more than others I certainly am disappointed in them.  Hardly matters if they last longer if they dont sound as good.,Not up to Par,1290816000,11 27 2010,Bad

A56EP6FFRH1YT,B0002E1O2C,J. Kim,Ive used these strings longer than any other strings Ive tried (about 7 years).  Last year I switched to DAddario EXP16s because they sounded better on the guitar I have now but still keep a pack of Nanowebs as a backup.  Here are my pros and cons of this string:Pros:+Easier to fret and play than other strings.  I dont know why; I looked up the tension stats on these strings and they seem to be equivalent or higher than other strings.  But they certainly are easier to fret (press down) and play than any other string Ive tried including other coated ones.  The coating on the Nanoweb strings is thinner than the Elixir Polyweb series but still feel very smooth and even slippery as some people remarked.  They have very little string squeak.+Last longer than any other strings Ive tried - maybe because of their brightness these strings mellow with age (as all strings do) but never really sound dull.  The only reason I saw to change them was when they became overly dirty or broke usually every few months of regular playing.+Very bright sound which cuts through well playing live with a full band and livens up the sound of cheaper guitars.  However this can also be a con (see below)Cons:-Cost more than most strings including other coated strings.-Can sound overly bright especially on some higher end guitars.  They tend to dominate the sound of the guitar which is good for cheaper guitars without quality woods or construction but not so good for a guitar that already resonates well.  For this reason I switched to the EXP16 phosphor bronze string for my current guitar. The EXP16 is coated but has a more natural/dark sound that complements the woodiness of the guitar better than the Elixirs (although not as easy to play).-Not available for export outside the U.S.  When I was working abroad I used to buy these from a U.S. company who would ship them to me.  Elixir changed their policy to prevent this so I ended up switching strings because the cost of Elixirs abroad was so high.,Bright sounding strings that are kind to fingertips,1295913600,01 25 2011,Good

A2Z89YMZZJWBHS,B0002E1O2C,Sunn Kram,Ive been using Nanoweb and Polyweb (no idea what the difference is) Elixirs consistently for years now on my Martin Jumbo Cutaway.I periodically try out other brands whenever I see something that might compete especially when another extended life or coated string is released. I would happily bail on Elixir at $13 a set if someone offered a cheaper option that worked as well. In fact I was quite optimistic about the $9 DAddario EXPs until I heard their tone begin to evaporate after a few days like any other string. Nothing that Ive used up to this point has gotten close to challenging the quality of the mighty purple box.The sound you get from these on Day 1 is crisp and beautiful as expected. Thats not where Elixirs kill the competition though. Its after 20 hours of play that they show their strength. You will still hear fresh bright tones from them when any other set would have already crossed into the dead zone. In fact I typically start breaking them before they begin to sound too dull. I play relatively aggressively and use palm-muting constantly allowing skin oils to eat right through the strings at the bridge.Saying that the tone lasts 3.5x longer (as stated on the box) might be a stretch but there is no question that you get at least double the life out of these at less than twice the cost of alternatives.If you are an occasional player or a music shop owner these are a no-brainer. The coating is extremely effective at combating the effects of time and oxygen exposure. For the everyday aggressive player you will simply get better tone and longer life.One nit-picky point of criticism: the packaging is an issue for me. WHY would any manufacturer still utilize tree-killing paper envelopes that allow strings to get stale? Im seriously asking! Ive got to be missing something here. A shred of plastic sealed around all 6 strings is greener more cost-efficient and it keeps the strings fresh (thank YOU DAddario Ill never leave your electric strings). I would happily buy Elixirs in bulk if I had faith in their shelf-life. Complaints about these snapping prematurely are probably valid happening when someone gets a set thats been sitting around for a while.

That is a little disapointing because these are suppost to last 3 to 5 times longer than regular strings.  I like the way they sound.  They are a little harder to play than the D Addario strings that I am used to on my other guitar and the Martins that I have used in the past.

ALHC64J88LVWO,B0002E1O2C,Wayfinder,Regardless of the string itself I insist on honesty in advertising and marketing.  So when I was earnestly considering ordering this string I read the summary in which it was stated:Elixir Strings are coated in a unique way to protect wound strings from your DNA and other contaminants.Ohhhh... protects my string from DNA!  Yeah that DNA really messes up guitar strings all right.  In fact its the worst contaminant EVER... worse even than the oils and acids on our skin... worse than the cells themselves that contain and hold the DNA from exposure because the DNA is the blueprint of those cells contained deep within protective walls.  But somehow that nasty ol DNA leaks out and contaminates our guitar strings!Honestly.  Its like none of us have ever attended a biology class because were musicians?As I read the reviews I noted review after review after review that seemed like some sort of marketing promo.  I noticed not one of those reviews indicated they had actually purchased the product from Amazon.  Hmmmm.The first honest review I found was one which said These strings sound somewhat artificial.  Ah finally one of the REAL reviews.Look the product may be good or not.  It may be the best string ever or not.  But am I going to spend time and money testing a string that apparently cant stand on its own quality without bogus marketing hype?Were musicians not morons.  If you want us to buy a string be totally honest in the marketing.  A quality string will sell itself by performance sound and long life.  No matter how heavy the marketing hype if the string is bad youll only sell one set.  If its good... you dont need the hype.EDIT FOLLOW-UP:  After reading numerous reviews this does actually seem to be a good set of strings.  Which means the product can stand on customer testimony alone and shouldnt need spin to sell.  Just sayin.  ;),Honesty is the first key in marketing,1385337600,11 25 2013,Average
A341MNU9GWBWKS,B0002E1O2M,CaptainButts,I read several reviews before purchasing these strings. Ive never bought any strings with any sort of coating on them but after putting these on my Yamaha acoustic it sounded great! They have very good high and low tones and give a more resonating tone to the whole guitar. My Yamaha is not a very expensive model but these strings make it sound like it is. If youre wanting to upgrade to a thicker set of strings definitely give these a try. The coating is supposed to make them last longer and resist corrosion and what not but they are also a little smoother on the fingertips when changing chord positions and sliding up and down the fret board.,Great tone!,1392336000,02 14 2014,Best
AOY459LVUBKLO,B0002E1O2M,Confidential Name,Time will tell if they last longer than strings 1/3rd the price. Visually they dont appear any different than cheaper Bronze wound strings. I was expecting something different but as far as sound goes the strings tuned well and only required some stretching 3 times to get them to stay in tune even after playing &#34;smear notes&#34; on several songs. My problem with cheaper strings (DeAngelo) was they would tarnish or rust quickly the winding would come lose and bare the inner string over the fret marks on the guitar. The company claims these are treated to prevent corrosion and should last 3 to 5 times longer. Ill know in a few weeks if that statement is true or not. Since these are literally triple the cost Ill know if it was worth the extra expense. Hopefully these are made in the USA instead of China like most other things we buy in America. Good or bad once I see the longevity of this set Ill add to this review at that time.,Nice tone....,1378166400,09 3 2013,Good

A2GVH4P25TXN8M,B0002E1O2M,D. Villella gadget geek,Ive been playing guitar for about 15 years - and within the last year bought my first Taylor guitar (Taylor Guitars 414CE-LTD Grand Auditorium Acoustic Electric Guitar). It came with these Elixir strings on it from the factory. I am blown away by the brightness and purity of the tone these strings produce. Whats even better is how long they last.Im pretty hard on my strings. I useDunlop Standard Tortex Picks 12 Pack Purple 1.14mmwhich are very stiff and chew up strings very quickly. The nanoweb wrap that they put on these string makes them last several MONTHS instead of weeks. Theyre a little bit more expensive then other major string brands.

A1TSKKBNV38E8Y,B0002E1O2M,K. Harriger K.R. Harriger,I hesitate to write this review simply because its pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves these strings. To be honest I was very very impressed with their feel and handling. I do think theyre the best playing strings Ive used when it comes to pure playability. Hands down none better. They were butter-smooth and great for flat picking. But for me it was a trade-off because I simply wasnt impressed with the tone. I even took the time to try them on three different guitars (all dreadnoughts): a classic maple sides/spruce top a mahogany back/sides with spruce top and a maple backs/sides with a nato top. On all three I didnt like the tone as much as the strings I was using. I really wanted to like them but they simply didnt have the tone of the medium gauge Martin SPs I normally use.This isnt to say theyre not great strings that sound different on other peoples guitars but I simply didnt like them on mine. I love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music I play in our jam group. The Elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the Martin strings I use and the treble sounds tinny vs. the clear ring of the Martins I normally use. To be fair the bass strings sound great and arent much different. I would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how youre going to use them. I play in acoustic groups and the Elixir strings just dont have what I need to be heard in spite of how great they feel under your fingers. If playability is more important than great tonal range then by all means buy these strings...you wont be disappointed. Im guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones.,Great feel and handling but not the sound I like,1391558400,02 5 2014,Average

They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now.

These are as good as any coated string on the market I prefer the thinner coating and super light strings.  Everyone has their preferences so you should try a few different gauges and manufacturers until you find your favorite string. These provide an nice smooth feel while providing excellent tone and they last reasonably well.  Of course that depends on your playing style and how much your fingers sweat when you play!  Oh and do yourself a favor and store your guitars in their cases when you are not playing them.

AW91VDERXXKGT,B0002E1O2W,Nessander,I tried these not knowing what to expect and have been very pleasantly surprised. I tend to have sweaty hands and my guitar strings get a lot of crud on them and then eventually rust. Although I have learned now to wipe them down each time I play they still deteriorate pretty quickly and its a pain. When I wipe them down with a cloth they leave black streaks of crud on the cloth.The Elixirs are not as bright as other strings when you first put them on -- that is true. However other strings lose their brightness after just a few hours of playing so I dont see this as a major disadvantage. The advantage is that these strings get very little crud on them. When I wipe them down theres nothing on the cloth! Ive even stopped wiping my strings down as carefully.So for a player like me these are a godsend. I dont detect any loss of tone. They are a bit slippery and some people have reported having trouble because of this but its fine for me.Definitely theyre worth a try. Although theyre twice as expensive as regular strings theyll last longer so theyre worth checking out!

They tend to be a little stiffer than ernie balls but I like the way they sound and they feel great when bending and sliding. I can keep these on my guitar for weeks of daily playing without the corrosion and deadness that I get with other brands.,Great corrosion resistant strings,1288828800,11 4 2010,Best
A2UDGB5BTYY51,B0002E1O3G,AMK TK,My favorite brand of strings right now. 8 guitars now are fitted. They bend easy last longer feel smoother and a shot of Finger Grease Spray just adds the icing to the cake,Excellent Strings,1394668800,03 13 2014,Best
A3RDS0DJ5EJGA7,B0002E1O3G,B,I havent owned my electric guitar for over a year but Ive only replaced its strings once. Ive been playing almost every day for an hour or two and it still looks and feels very new. At this rate it seems that the current strings I have installed would last forever. Would recommend to anybody looking for a long lasting set.,Lasts a really long time,1392076800,02 11 2014,Best
A1QE7VZE507TO7,B0002E1O3G,Brian Hogan Dog person,I get everything on Amazon now.  Need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping.  Elixir is what Tom Anderson uses and I trust his judgment.  He makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course. Have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings I do Not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time.  Stretch them bend them and they dont break.  If your bending a couple steps or more then I would love to know what string holds up consistently.  Thanks much.,there strings.,1376870400,08 19 2013,Best
A3PQULECO9OAV6,B0002E1O3G,Darkrin,not two weeks after I put these on the A string broke close to the ball on the string.  I break high e strings on occasion.  but something as thick as an A string?? maybe it was a defective string as I thankfully bought two sets and I was able to pull the A out of the other set and it has been fine since.  now however I have the dilemma of should I just buy more strings and just use the second set as I need them.  Further more do I stick with the same brand.  that is supposed to last longer than average strings.  At this point I am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there.  I will update once I decide if I should stick with this brand or go back to super slinkysupdate 3/25well another month went by(a week ago) and the D string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe I either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be. either way its losing another star.  if it happens with a different set of strings I will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly,they sound a lot brighter,1394236800,03 8 2014,Bad
A34KO3JNKTZU6Y,B0002E1O3G,G.R.K.,Yes these strings are amazing.  I discovered these on my new Taylor and now Ive put them on all my gits.  They really are the better string.  I was a fan of Ernie Ball on my electrifieds and DAddario on my acoustics but no more Im only using these.  They are brighter in tone to me and that really brightens up my acoustics.  They bend easy so they are nice on the electrics.  They do however seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but its worth it.,These will make your git sound like something its never sounded like before,1360540800,02 11 2013,Best
A34VZEFXQJJ7AT,B0002E1O3G,Guitarslim,Been a fan of these for years now. I occasionally use other strings for fun but these will always be my go to strings every time. They feel great on the fingers for such a long period of time sliding is easy and they keep their tone forever it seems like. I recommend these to everyone I talk to who plays guitar and they always stick with em. GET EM! You wont be sorry.,Get em,1361577600,02 23 2013,Best
A3A3ZCWP7Z4V4K,B0002E1O3G,H18,They will always sound the same as the very first day I love this strings currently on all my guitars,Cant find them when I travel great buy!,1371513600,06 18 2013,Best
